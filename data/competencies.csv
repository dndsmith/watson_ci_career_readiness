"A large component of my internship involves empowering the girls in the program to love themselves and lead healthy, active lifestyles. At the beginning of each after-school meeting, the girls have a journal prompt that asks them to reflect on the previous lesson we discussed and then allowing them to share their thoughts. I believe this was an incredible way to me to analyze progress and present future topics that needed to be implemented again. From their journal reflections, I felt that I watched the girls grow more confident in themselves. Middle school girls commonly never discuss with friends or family some of the sensitive topics we go over. By sharing their thoughts, they were able to connect with each other and feel united by their feelings.",1
"A significant part of my position was to act as the President Business Ambassador. I brought together 16 student volunteers to aid with multiple events on-campus. We were successful in completing these events in a professional, efficient way. Together, we were able to provide incoming students with the knowledge and confidence they will need to be successful at Clemson.",1
During the semester I trained new interns on fundamental tasks around the office. I showed an intern how we file important documents because the filing is done strategically and then I left her with the task to go complete another project I was working on. We both then communicated to our supervisor that the filing had been completed.,0
"As a director, I am forced to take the lead on all projects and do things that other may not want to do. I delegate work evenly and fairly in addition to taking responsibility for my whole team and their actions. This includes making sure my marketing team knows how important the work we are doing in Haiti is. Because my entire team was new this semester, I had to constantly work to help them understand the vision of CEDC and get everyone on the same page.",0
"As a part of my internship, I was invited to give a presentation to the Spiro Advisory Board ahead of the annual Pitch Smackdown. This is a board of Clemson Alumni, professors, and other influential venture capitalists and angel investors with a vested interest in Clemson entrepreneurship. During my presentation, I established a rapport and sense of purpose behind my and Dr. Mentor’s case study initiative focused on highlighting alumni entrepreneurship and encouraging student entrepreneurship.",1
"As an intern at Clemson CAPS, I assist the broader organizational goals of the entire organization by promoting mental health awareness, and using my unique position as both Clemson student, and CAPS employee to promote the services we provide and assist in executing the long term goals of the organization. For example, I attended a Health Fair put on by Clemson where Person and I handed out brochures of the various programs CAPS offers, and met with interested students to walk them through the process of requesting counseling and meeting with clinicians in CAPS.",1
"As I am working in a small company, we have a very interactive and friendly atmosphere. My  seniors often discuss their project ideas with me and take my opinion into consideration. They also  gave me the freedom to [m]ake my own decisions regarding certain graphic presentations even though they were probably different from their own style.",1
"As I mentioned in the collaboration section, there was another intern with whom I worked closely. At the beginning of the semester I had the opportunity to lead as I was given the responsibility to  inform her of various things that were happening in our programs as well as teach her how to work  our database that we use for participant data.",0
"I am technically above over 8 people on the CEDC organization chart, which at one time would've scared me. Now, I feel comfortable delegating work and trusting my teammates, to the point where  I am now taking on a large leadership role next semester as Assistant Program Director.",0
"As the Director, I had to encourage my team to reach their full potential for the betterment of  Organization. I communicated their accomplishments to the outlet heads so that they could see that we were a resource for them to use.",1
"I became well versed in making sure everyone was doing their tasks. To make sure everything was done every day, I had to step up and set a good example by rounding everyone up and getting them to do what was needed rather than slack off. This was hard at first, but after a while it became easier to motivate others to do what was needed.",0
"At Organization we do this every single day. The environment here is nothing short of a positive, encouraging atmosphere where people are always pushing you to achieve more and better the company's overall goal.",1
"Being in charge of the graphics team, there were many instances where I was able to direct and lead members to achieve a vision I had if the task was delegated to them. There were many instances where I would be overwhelmed with large projects, but would effectively communicate the plan and vision with others so that they could create the graphics I needed.",0
Coordinating video shoot times with different departments and getting people to show up to commitments was something I was tasked with doing for a few projects.,0
"I had a problem mid-way through the semester with my higher ups not being responsible and allowing the lower ranking workers to get away with things that should not have been allowed. I had to call a meeting with everyone who was in that position to completely go over everything that they were supposed to have already been doing, and then added new steps to increase accountability in that position. I had to spend a lot of time checking back over their work to make sure that everything was on track, but so far the work has been exceptional!",0
"Aligning group objectives with global objectives was one of my primary roles in my internship. I was working with teams who are working on a variety of projects to address needs in Haiti. In order to help them progress, I would often help them align their narrow objectives such as writing a literature review to why they are doing it. There was a constant need for relating small goals to global issues, particularly the global water crisis.",1
"As team lead, it is important to recognize and capitalize on the unique strengths of team members in order to maximize effectiveness. I was able to do this by identifying individual skills and personalities in team members and encouraging them to apply them to their work for the betterment of the Organization.",1
"As the director of Technical Solutions, I provided my assistance to other groups and my group member as needed, enabling them to achieve their goals. I also discussed accomplishments and team progress to the CEDC board of directors in weekly meetings.",1
"I define leadership as an influence on the others around you. How I showed leadership this semester was always encouraging if someone doesn't know something, ask, so we can find that solution. If I don't know that solution, the internet is a great tool. This promote collaboration and technology skills.",1
I support everyone in our office and I try to empower others to strive to do their best. I have had so many opportunities to learn about the vision of the COB and how to continue the vision.,1
I work to lead creative inquiry groups and other interested on campus organizations in serving as an extension of the Clemson agricultural extension program and working to connect the community and Clemson students to local food systems.,1
"Many of the other student workers would ask me what there was today, and we would all work together to accomplish goals. Each employee has a special talent when it came to jobs that would utilize their potential we were sure to put them on that job.",1
Intern served as my right hand and delegated responsibilities to his peers. He showed managerial leadership even when spread thin between two research projects and many assignments I gave him.,0
Intern’s ability to lead and inspire those around her is inspiring and a great reflection of her success in this internship. She encouraged her residents (members of the Wellness LLC) to be well and take part in different wellness opportunities on campus.,1
"Intern brings a level a poise to the work she does that very few othere in her peer group could acheive. She takes charge of situations, she is self-directed and she finds ways to bring great things out of those she works with, even beyond what they thought was possible.",0
