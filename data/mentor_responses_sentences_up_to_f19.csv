462,462_0,"""This is hard because Becca possesses all of these skills."
462,462_1,Her ability to lead and understand what is needed in a situation is remarkable.
462,462_2,She is a born leader once she is given the tools to succeed.
462,462_3,"She needs to understand what is being asked and how to do the task, once that is understood she can easily do anything you ask her and go above and beyond.""
"
463,463_0,This is hard because she doesn't really have a weak area.
463,463_1,Eileen could work more at leading others.
463,463_2,"Her comfort zone is working by herself.
"
464,464_0,"""This is just a hard area for an intern to work on because they are generally the """"low man on the totem pole."""

"
465,465_0,This is just because she wasn't really a project lead this semester
465,465_1,"so I wasn't able to see her leadership skills.
"
466,466_0,This is mainly due to experience level and opportunities to grow leadership.
466,466_1,I've started to see developments on this front recently assisting in training for new hires.
466,466_2,"This will come with time and experience.
"
467,467_0,"""This is not something she is able to do a lot in this position, but in the future maybe working more closely with the other interns and GAs in the office she could take the lead on a social media campaign""
"
468,468_0,"""This is partially because we don't give her the opportunity to """"lead"""" others in our office, although she does a fantastic job of taking the """"lead"""" on entire projects."
468,468_1,"I do think that she might benefit from thinking about the """"why"""" behind the student video features we do in addition to getting them done."
468,468_2,"Her work is excellent, but stepping back from it to see how each of these features or stories we tell fits into our overall strategy as an office would benefit her."
468,468_3,"Once again, this is partially our office's fault for not explaining these things and more clearly articulating our vision, but I think someone can easily get burned out in a role if they approach it in a way that is too workmanlike."
468,468_4,"If you're just completing tasks to get them done instead of seeing how they contribute to a greater mission, it's not hard to see why you would lose interest or burn out.""

472,472_1,"Either way, it is a valuable skill for any professional to have and would be worth investing time in improving.""
"
473,473_0,"""This may be only my perception, since I was not close with Shahab 8hrs a day, but I feel he could learn new things faster or solve problems more efficiently by brainstorming with colleagues and formulating rough ideas to others and receive feedback or alternate approaches.""
"
474,474_0,This one is difficult - only improvement might be to communicate better with questions.
474,474_1,"Hard to say because I feel Anna is already good at this.

483,483_0,"""This should not be seen as a knock on Dani's ability, but more a reflection on her experience."
483,483_1,"As her full-time career grows, I have no doubt that she will become a great leader."

486,486_2,"One of Sneha's tasks was to work with another undergraduate level intern, and she sufficiently helped and guided him whenever he approached her with specific questions."

499,499_2,I would often find he had work completed but wanted to get something else done too before handing off what he completed to another teammate.
499,499_3,This reduces agility and makes teammates wonder why things are taking so long (when in fact they've been done).
