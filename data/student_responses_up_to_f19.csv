"During one of our weekly fraud training meetings, the fraud prevention manager encouraged all the employees to continue to work hard to prevent passport fraud. "
"(this is repeated from before, but also with the stipulation that throughout this whole process I performed the basic-level shifts to show how they *should* be done, providing an example to strive towards). When I started up as CPT, a bunch of SPOs were, basically, awful- sleeping in cars, not scanning all buildings, not meeting scan times, going inside, ect. This was at first due to lack of viewable scans (when we were transitioning between systems), but it continued afterwards once the norm of ""slacking"" was established. Changing that was difficult and took many tough conversations and arm-twisting (both for SGTs and LTs to watch for this, as well as with the offending SPOs). With our low numbers now and lack of scan checks with the move and issues for the past month beforehand, there was a danger that this slack-ness would return. I am happy to say it has not, which I think is attributable to a new norm of *quality* to the shifts done, even if we are low on SPOs. "
A bottleneck was formed just before the second design review which I solved by taking initiative to talk to the different people involved and trying to understand the different points of view. I further communicated this to the sponsors in the review.
"A couple of the other undergraduates working in the lab and I often discussed what projects we were working which allowed us to share our questions and ideas with each other. At one point all of us were running PCR and gels at the same time. We each encountered different obstacles but continued to discuss what problems we faced. By reaching out to another undergraduate, we found we both encountered the same problem in our gels. By simply changing the liquid the gels were placed in we were able to solve our problem."
A couple of the projects I was able to propose a different idea and input different opinion for the ability to put out better work and better quality. 
"A couple weeks ago I accepted an internship in Simpsonville for this coming fall. I had previously committed to continuing my part time UPIC internship during my full time internship in the fall. But since I will be commuting two hours a day I felt that I wouldn't have adequate time to put towards my work with Michael, which I didn't want to happen. So during one of our meetings I had to bring this issue up and we talked about what was best for me and for the office. We both agreed that it was best I didn't continue in the fall, as they need and deserve someone who can put the time into the work. It was a difficult conversation to have since I had already committed to him and had to go back on my word. But I told him as soon as I got the offer and I wanted to make things as right as possible. He told me he respected that I had the guts to tell him that I didn't think I could handle both jobs and wanted to talk to him about it in person. I really appreciated him saying that because it was nerve wracking to have the conversation with him because I didn't want him to be disappointed. "
"A design lead, I had the most knowledge and experience working with Adobe software. Because of this, I had to encourage my teammates to be vocal about their ideas while also teaching them about the possibilities of graphic design and the guidelines for an aesthetically-pleasing layout."
A fellow worker helped lead a census.
A few other interns and I worked on a data report. I was able to lead the report and present it to my mentor for feedback. 
"A few sessions into the summer, I asked to take over an information session the abroad office hosted. I presented a slideshow to many parents and students, engaging them in the goals of our office and sparking interest in different abroad programs. We worked with many different majors and educational goals, aligning several different types of students with the goal of studying abroad."
"A good example of leadership would be the agents in my office planning for the fair. We all sat down and came up with what each agent wanted to do at the fair. We had a group discussion about what each person thought they could do to help the other with their idea and delegated tasks that we could do to help each other. We could have just all done something on our own but instead we all helped each other with the planning, preparing, and running of each other’s activity for the fair. Everyone helped each other and used their strengths to assist the others. It was a great example of how much better events can be when people contributed their strengths to achieve an overall goal. "
"A large component of my internship involves empowering the girls in the program to love themselves and lead healthy, active lifestyles. At the beginning of each after-school meeting, the girls have a journal prompt that asks them to reflect on the previous lesson we discussed and then allowing them to share their thoughts. I believe this was an incredible way to me to analyze progress and present future topics that needed to be implemented again. From their journal reflections, I felt that I watched the girls grow more confident in themselves. Middle school girls commonly never discuss with friends or family some of the sensitive topics we go over. By sharing their thoughts, they were able to connect with each other and feel united by their feelings. "
A lot of people come to my boss for advise and i picked up very good lessons from it
A lot of the time I liked to encourage the graphics team to continue to be creative and come up with brand new ideas and original graphics on behalf of the recruits we were targeting. We always were able to collaborate together as a team to create the best graphics for the recruits and football program. 
A lot of times in the lab we are presented with a problem that may not have a simple solution because we do different things everyday. I am the longest returning student worker in the lab and I am sort of the liaison between management and the new people so I usually lead the new employees.
"A main aspect of planning Speak Out was reaching out to community partners such as Safe Harbor, Foothills Alliance, and Pickens County Advocacy Center and requesting their involvement and resources in the event. Reaching out to organizations that we had never utilized personally seemed daunting at first, and required us to really understand each organization's goal and values. Then, we had to modify our approach to communicating with them in regards to the event in explaining why their presence and support at this event would be of great value to the Clemson community. This meant explaining the underlying values of our Speak Out event and what we hoped to accomplishment, and how their involvement would be critical to not only our success as a CAPS practice, but the overall benefit of awareness that it would bring to the community regarding issues we are all passionate about. "
A main project for the compliance department is to debate and interpret NCAA bylaws for the rest of the athletic department. I was frequently called upon to ask questions and offer opinions in these types of situations. 
"A major objective of the company is to keep costs low, and reduce data clutter. Thus, keeping the same suppliers and avoiding unnecessarily adding new parts/vendors to the internal system is encouraged. One of my tasks was to size up and choose components from several manufacturers for the needs of our projects while adhering to these company goals"
"A major part of my internship required me to organize material and set-up meetings and discussions with our core team. During one of recent meetings, I served as the lead facilitator and engaged our team in discussions about expanding the nursing program and coordinating our course for next semester. Leading a meeting with senior professors in the nursing program was a unique and rewarding experience. I was able to showcase my organization and leadership skills. "
"A major part of my internship required me to organize material and set-up meetings and discussions with our core team. During one of recent meetings, I served as the lead facilitator and engaged our team in discussions about expanding the nursing program and coordinating our course for next semester. Leading a meeting with senior professors in the nursing program was a unique and rewarding experience. I was able to showcase my organization and leadership skills. Since this is my third rotation as a UPIC intern, I have now taken on more of a mentor role. This semester I have taught the newer UPIC interns the roles that I once had in this position. I helped them find their strengths and interests in order to build a stronger overall team. "
A majority of the work we did was teamed based. It took multiple people working together to set up for 200+ people events. 
"A minor defect was found in one of the components of a turbo, since it was not so important so everyone was ignoring it. But I saw this one manager who stood up and started working on it. He organised meetings with all senior management team and he made the issue look a major one.This was a very good example of leadership set up by him."
"A new production line was being started for a valued customer at the production facility. I was trained to implement time studies as well as work instructions for the new line. My supervisor, made me and a team of people work on it on the same. Various decisions ranging from material planning, number of parts produced, scrap information as well as time taken to produce a single part were made by my supervisor along with a team of colleagues. It was a good experience for me. I also attended scrap meetings which took place with the COO of the plant. Scrap evaluation was done in those meetings. "
A part of my supervisors job involves social media. I was able to bounce idea back and forth with her and another coworker about how to improve the content being put up on social media. 
"A section of student patrol involves the locking of academic buildings on a schedule every night. In the recent months, training new people was becoming difficult because many of our trainers would take different paths which confused the trainee. I needed a standard way to train everyone so that it would be easier for the trainee's to remember, and therefore pass their certifications. My co-captain and I asked our lieutenants to think of a way of standardizing it, after multiple ideas being tossed around we landed on letting the Buildings Lieutenant video her route and post it to our collective google drive so that we could have standards set. "
"A significant part of my position was to act as the President Business Ambassador. I brought together 16 student volunteers to aid with multiple events on-campus. We were successful in completing these events in a professional, efficient way. Together, we were able to provide incoming students with the knowledge and confidence they will need to be successful at Clemson. "
A specific example is one of the interns asked about how it can encode and decode structures into a JSON object. When this happens I went over to the white board and we led a discussion where I drew and he was talking to walk himself through as I drew it out in order to make sure understanding was clear. I feel that this was an effective way to lead the group and teach some knew things. 
A startup idea suggested had the potential to be modeled as a social entrepreneurial venture. This simple idea steamed to a valuable idea in which the underprivileged community members of large metropolitan cities may reap the benefit of the successful execution of the business.
"A supervisor I worked with on a legal project would often give me tasks to complete to help publish current data on Council of Europe related matters. One of the things she knew I was competent in was law, because of my past experiences and internships in law enforcement and private law firms. As a result, I was assigned to read legal case summaries and reports and summarize them because she knew I was competent in that area. "
"A time during my internship when I encouraged discussion among my peers to achieve a common goal is when I was given the task to post a social media promotion for the pool closing down for a couple weeks because of maintenance. Due to the sensitivity of this situation, we were each able to give our input concerning what the promotion should say, as well as how it should be said. In the end, we were all able to come up with a successful solution that informed Campus Recreation's followers about the situation without raising any issues or questions."
"A time during my internship when I encouraged discussion where individuals could express different points of view was when meeting with the HRLT (HR Leadership Team) to review the design of my ""Meet the HRLT"" booklet. I have learned in Graphic Communications that you cannot marry yourself to any design or idea, as clients will always have their own ideas and suggestions, as well. It is important to remain open-minded and listen to the opinions and ideas of others. Through discussion with the HRLT, we developed a shared vision on how to rearrange some information on pages, and how to re-word some verbage to have the best possible end result. "
A time I empowered others to achieve a shared vision is when I helped create a new bus route for the next school year. I needed to discuss the reasons for why each stop was so important as well as the reason for why the bus was going the direction it was. I had to present this to a leading member of Parking and Transportation Services and explain to them in a way that made sense to someone who did not have a student's prospective so they could see my point of view.
A time that I helped employees express different opinions was when I went to a meeting with Reagan where we met with the new Communications Director at Sikes hall and talked about her goals for the future and Reagan and I had different ideas as to what should be done and we all worked together to express them in a productive way. I even helped lead the conversation when talking about the marketing strategy.
A time when I noticed a coworker who capitalized on the strengths of each individual was during a monthly meeting to discuss the progress of the research study. She methodically addressed each person on the research team to confirm that he or she was following through on job duties. She encouraged each person to focus on her strengths. Any weaknesses or challenges that a person faced were shared among group and suggestions were offered. Her leadership skills allowed for a meaningful meeting and for each member of the team to have a clear vision of upcoming tasks. 
"A time where I served as a conduit to assist my group was during one of our round-table edit sessions where each of the writers in the group looked over each other's work. I echoed the interests of my supervisors, representing the broader organizational objectives of Creative Inquiry, in making suggestions to other writers on how better to improve their papers, based on our writing model. I did so through electronic comments on Microsoft Word, which I reiterated to my fellow writers to follow."
"Acted as an undergraduate teaching assistant to lead the classroom in discussion of new technologies in society, specifically in the health industry."
"After attending events, we had to gather together and tell our thoughts before the write up. I would synthesize these views and make sure everyone's voice was heard."
"After discussing how to lead workshops with my fellow interns, I shared the idea we came up with to go about them in a different, yet more effective, way. "
"After losing the first mentor, both Wilson and I had to step up and assume positions of leadership. We debated the best use of our time, the best design for a product, and possible solutions to problems we encountered. "
"After our events were over, I gathered people in order to get feedback on the events. It was important for me to gain valuable feedback so that the events are even better next year. "
"After several meetings, I persuaded my mentor to accept my idea and finally we ran a study which is designed by me."
"After the camps I worked at were over, the staff would all come together and discuss things we thought went well and things we thought could be improved. Being confident and learning how to communicate these ideas in a positive way was something I did really well, and I think it helped others to do the same thing as well."
"After the Entrepreneurship and Innovation Celebration, Helen and I presented our work and accomplishments throughout the semester to the Spiro Board, and described how we'd been leading the initiative to spread entrepreneurship more widely across the seven different colleges here on campus. We received very positive feedback and enthusiasm from this group of stakeholders to continue encouraging our efforts."
"Again, because of the division in work and many projects nearly complete in design, it was difficult to take leadership. I noticed the way work was distributed was based on where each of our strengths lied, with one being great with technical drawings and knowing the firm's standards, somebody else being strong with materials and attention to detail, and mine being able to make presentable work to appeal to clients. Because of this, work was divided up by who had the best strengths for a project and passed on when another's strength was required. "
"Again, during our lean events, Lisa and I brought together large groups on people and had to get them to agree on a new process. We had to keep in mind the larger goals of the university and keep everyone aligned on what we wanted and how to achieve it moving forward. "
"Again, on the elected board of the intern networking group, I helped facilitate meetings and provided guidance to enable the forward progress of group tasks."
"Again, teaching the MedEx students allowed me to expand on my leadership skills, show them what the mission of the program was, and assist them in working through this. "
"Again, this takes me back to working on the workflows with the whole office. The majority of the office would sit in on these planning meetings and everyone would hash out their ideas and thoughts for the work flows and as we were putting together a step by step process. There were many times where we stopped and I, or someone else, would bring up an idea that made other people express their opinions on the process steps and what is the right order or if there should be steps added in."
"Again, when meeting about the Clemson World research process and compilation, I wanted to hear opinions and advice from people in other departments. During the meeting, we discussed what would make the process easier and how I could incorporate that into a how-to guide for conducting Clemson World research."
"Again, working with the director of science communication, I have been working on helping him and the department work together to create a new photojournalism style for some research project image sets. "
"Alexander and I spent a lot of time working together, so it was very important to me that we both had our voices heard when creating something. Most specifically, we had the task of creating a powerpoint slide, and wanted to bring all of our ideas together to make something we could be proud of. Sharing that common goal helped us to be respectful of each other, and have a final product that incorporated elements contributed by both of us."
"Aligning group objectives with global objectives was one of my primary roles in my internship. I was working with teams who are working on a variety of projects to address needs in Haiti. In order to help them progress, I would often help them align their narrow objectives such as writing a literature review to why they are doing it. There was a constant need for relating small goals to global issues, particularly the global water crisis. "
All interns will have meetings with the manager where every individual is allowed to express his/her views contributing to company's goal. 
"All interns, on their first day were told what the organization does and were introduced to various equipment and software that the company uses. All of us were given reading material to strengthen the fundamentals of IC engines. Shortly after we were asked about the projects that we had worked on and the software which we were familiar with. Together with their observations from interviews and face-to-face questions, they allotted us to respective departments. In this way, an industrial engineer with a mechanical engineering background was found to be an ideal candidate for Mfg Ops intern position. I was a great substitute in that position by virtue of my 3 previous internships on the shop floor. Two other undergrad interns were proficient with CAD software since they had used it in their SAE BAJA team to design the frame of their all-terrain vehicle."
"All of the donors to the business school typically have one goal in mind: Building tomorrow's business leaders today. For one event we were managing, a special donor event held in Raleigh, NC, I was tasked with the job of calling several people to see if they were planning on attending. Some of the donors who answered the phone were short and choppy, quickly cutting me off to say ""I'm not donating any money."" I had to quickly deviate from my script and ensure them that I was not calling to solicit donations - merely see if they received their invitation and if they were able to attend the event. Some of the people who had been slightly rude at the beginning of the call, quickly agreed to attend the event!"
All of the leaders in my lab work with respect and good leadership skills. My boss delegated work to the people in the lab so that their strengths were utilized
"All of the supervisors that work at CB + D, show great leadership skills and molded us interns into leaders; they definitely instilled some of those leadership skills into us. Katrin, Rob, and Nathan showed time and time again what it was like to lead us to success."
"All the employees are supervisors are leaders every day here when they advise and talk to students. Same with communication, they know each student is different and they have to approach things differently every time. Some students are going to be fairly confident within themselves and know exactly what they want out of a study abroad experience, while others might need a little more encouragement to get out of their shell. They take the time to get to know students based on their personality and interests, and capitalize on them to find the program that is right for them. They do this day in and day out and they never get burned out or lose patience."
All the supervisors and mentors in Clemson Abroad do a really good job of relying on the interns and capitalizing on their strengths. In the Clemson Abroad the interns do real work and are utilized to make the office run and to get everything done.
"Almost every day I would discuss the daily routines with my fellow team members. We would correct any mistakes and develop better ways in mowing, blowing, and raking."
"Along with a talented, driven group of Clemson students, I am helping to create Clemson large-scale University hackathon. Fashioned in the style of MLH.io, CUhackit will be open to all students and will encourage team-oriented problem solving over the course of the 23-hour event. Knowing that this event is being planned, I approached my mentor, Sam, about the possibility of our team partnering with CUhackit. I recognized that both organizations goals and interests aligned and had resources that synergize well. After approaching Sam, I was able to secure resources that would advance CUhackit through the use of Guidebook. This was a win-win for both organizations."
"Although I usually complete intern tasks, and don't take a great leadership role in the office, I set a standard for myself to partner with and support the office as a servant leader by completing tasks to the best of my ability. "
"Although I was not there for meetings about nutrition that were conducted with the various members of sports teams, I have observed my mentor capitalize on the different strengths and backgrounds of student athletes when having meetings regarding their nutrition. Athletes arrange to meet with my mentor to develop a nutrition plan that is unique to their body type and sport. Being able to adjust and compensate for the wants and needs of athletes as well as utilize their strengths and weaknesses is essential in these meetings. "
"Although I'm the youngest, I have been working the longest. Therefore, there has been many instances where I have been look upon for guidance on what to do."
"Although this job did not have a specific leadership position, by taking initiative ,when I had no direction available, to complete an assignment would be an act of leadership to complete a common goal. "
An example of a time I did this was during the project with the Continuing Medical Education (CME) office. We had a shared vision to provide CME credit to all attendees of the Research Education Series and I worked alongside them to ultimately achieve the goal. 
"An example of leadership would be when I observed Mark Jensen (my mentor), divvying up tasks to the three interns (myself included) that were working at the time. He had one intern who was familiar with all the server rooms take a new intern so that they could inventory those rooms while having more experienced intern teach the new intern. He then had me go assist a teacher with classroom technology, as I was experienced with assisting people from my job at the CCIT Support Center."
"An example of this occurring on the job would be when one of my fellow interns was producing a piece that I knew needed to be redone. Here at Campus Banner we strive to produce quality over and over so that customers are content and return. As I saw this coworker compromising quality, I took it upon myself to make suggestions to redo the print. This is the way in which I showed leadership."
"Another major project of this internship is organization of our biannual Board meeting, where our Advisory Board comes together on campus to discuss initiatives, upcoming projects and future goals. I was able to take lead on organizing this meeting, including travel plans, setting up, day of schedule, entertaining and meals and the overall agenda to ensure we both reflect our successes towards our goals and focus on broader organizational goals as the program grows and expands."
Anytime the Managers stepped out they always insisted that i specifically would make sure things are operating smoothly as if they were there. Maintaining a professional office dynamic. 
"As a department, we asked Guest Services associates what are some ways to improve the department from their perspective."
"As a director, I am forced to take the lead on all projects and do things that other may not want to do. I delegate work evenly and fairly in addition to taking responsibility for my whole team and their actions. This includes making sure my marketing team knows how important the work we are doing in Haiti is. Because my entire team was new this semester, I had to constantly work to help them understand the vision of CEDC and get everyone on the same page."
"As a forestry intern, our boss frequently gave us tasks to do on our own to help us learn. One thing we did was learn how to value timber stands. Once a tract is cruised, we have to take all the data and determine the value based on valuation trends and volumes. This can be a daunting task to do becuase there are so many variables involved. As ""quarterback"", I somewhat knew how to do some things, so I helped others do it as well so that we all learn the process. In the end, this internship is all about learning in order to be successful in our careers. Knowledge is the most empowering thing I've learned during this internship. I attend many professional conferences with professional foresters and I'm able to bring this up in conversation."
"As a group we are able to solve student problems however, we know which one of us should lead the discussion as they know more about the application than the rest of us or have had more experience dealing with a specific problem."
"As a intern, not so much leadership role."
"As a manager of the RV parking for football season at the Snow Family Outdoor Fitness and Wellness Center, I was a leader and had to keep everyone interested in parking (over 300 people) up-to-date and aware of what was happening. Since there was construction on the property, things worked differently than normal, and I had to guide those interested, and help answer questions about why the reservation process was so complex. "
"As a member of the HR Engagement Committee, I encouraged others to take a well-rounded approach to getting to know there colleagues and giving back to the greater Clemson community. I led my team through a series of service projects that would benefit the entire HR office. For example, our food and toiletry drive was most successful as we worked together to determine a donation and pick up schedule. "
"As a mentor when I held meetings with my mentees, I would have different topics to speak about. For each topic, sometimes I would open the floor for people to discuss even though some topics were difficult."
"As a mentor, I am responsible for helping the freshman adjust to college life, set goals, and stay organized and responsible for their own education. I served as a conduit during registration and housing sign up for my mentees. I was able to listen to their goals and then apply them in a way that would help them, keep them on track, and eventually, achieve them during their time in college. "
"As a merchandise associate for Disney, we are constantly reminded of our guest's high expectations and our dedication to courtesy. After working for a few weeks, I was able to take a class called 'Next Level Courtesy,' which outlined tools and techniques to provide exemplary service to each guest. This involves engaging with the guest to form a great first impression, discovering what makes each guest unique, recommending products that fit the guests need, and closing the interaction. For older cast members, this was a different method than they were previously using. Each cast member was able to express his/her concerns about these changes and their effectiveness. We were all able to learn from each other and take each input to form the best process."
"As a more experienced employee in the pressroom, I am often responsible for leading and encouraging in standards of practice so that we meet all of the Institute's goals and represent the Institute in the best way that we can. "
"As a part of my internship, I was invited to give a presentation to the Spiro Advisory Board ahead of the annual Pitch Smackdown. This is a board of Clemson Alumni, professors, and other influential venture capitalists and angel investors with a vested interest in Clemson entrepreneurship. During my presentation, I established a rapport and sense of purpose behind my and Dr. Hannon's case study initiative focused on highlighting alumni entrepreneurship and encouraging student entrepreneurship."
As a part of the 'burst builds' and 'run at rates' the monitors would meet to document open issues and assign responsibility to different individuals/departments. Leadership from the operations manager played a big part in this.
"As a part of the School Book Project, I was tasked with assisting the project head collect funds that would provide summer reading books to all of the elementary school students of a local Title 1 school. We ended up deciding that we’d communicate with various student organizations on campus and raise funds that way. I was able to bring in $300 worth of donations from student groups that have demonstrated passion for philanthropy, aligning the goals of their organizations, our internship, and the elementary school in a way that made us all feel good."
"As a team leader, I have to manage and evaluate each of the team members and if they are maintaining a suitable working standard or not. We worked together to "
"As a UPIC, I am a leader within the CI lab. I have given presentations on studies, helped other students create and implement their own studies, and communicated expectations and tasks needed to be done. I have also presented at Clemson's FOCI and plan to present at a Southeastern Psychological Association conference this spring to communicate the findings of a study that my group implemented. "
"As a UPIC, I am also part of the Creative Inquiry that my mentor is in charge of. I serve as a leader in that group of students and help them with certain tasks"
"As a worker for CORE we were always leading trips and organizing trips. This required communication with participants via email, phone and text message. Being prepared as a leader to answer any questions people may have about the location and ternary of our trip was key in being a good leader. We communicated for trip preparation by creating a google docs with an emergency action plan, time control plan and literary for the day. We also sent out emails the week before a trip went out to let participants know what to bring with them on the trip. "
As an Aspire intern I was also enrolled in the Aspire CI. The ending project for the CI was to produce a project proposal and present your research to the staff. We were assigned groups to complete the assignment with: as you know group projects are never easy. The members of my group could never agree or they would criticize the opinions that our group members shared. I had to be the neutral member in this situation in order for the group to make progress and be productive. I would often suggest ideas that would be a compromise for both of their ideas. 
As an important auxiliary department of the university we made efforts on our social media platforms to promote the messages of other departments and organizations across campus in order to help the in their goals to communicate effectively with the students faculty and staff
As an instructor I was constantly having to encourage the older participants that this was beneficial and necessary for their health. They are very set in their ways so it took a lot of strength to stand to them and tell them how to make the lives they had already mastered better. 
"As an intern at Clemson CAPS, I assist the broader organizational goals of the entire organization by promoting mental health awareness, and using my unique position as both Clemson student, and CAPS employee to promote the services we provide and assist in executing the long term goals of the organization. For example, I attended a Health Fair put on by Clemson where Savannah and I handed out brochures of the various programs CAPS offers, and met with interested students to walk them through the process of requesting counseling and meeting with clinicians in CAPS. "
"As an intern for the FIRST program, I needed to collaborate with the Student Org in order to organize and implement events that were beneficial for the students. In order to accomplish this, we had meetings throughout the month in which we would plan these events. I would lead the discussion and make sure everyone had a chance to voice their opinion, and then we would vote on a course of action. This worked very well, and we ended up having a successful and productive year."
As an intern I have sat in on many meetings taking meeting minutes and have had multiple opportunities to hear bosses and coworkers converse and respect one another while differing in opinions to eventually reach a common ground. 
As an intern I was able to lead a tour around the swine center in Clemson. While showing the different 4-H members around the swine farm I was able to discuss not only the many parts of the actual swine farm and industry but about the many ideas that are mentioned about the swine industry. Through this tour I was able to open up discussion about the many things we hear about the pork industry and provide information/facts about pork products and swine. 
"As an intern in the development office, when I first started working there the onboarding process was very complicated and if you were not the meticulous it was easy to not learn necessary materials. I proposed to my boss that I take on a project to create an entire new intern manual from scratch. This manual would have everything from the confidentiality pledge to instructions how to communicate with donors and everything in between. At first she was reluctant to have a first-year intern handle such a large task, but was convinced when I showed her my rough draft plan and explained how I knew what would be best to go in the manual because of my experience going through onboarding as an intern. After agreeing to let me create this manual and new onboarding system, I worked to create a very thorough, robust, and informational new intern manual. I took feedback from the other interns and team members we worked with to create a one-inch thick binder that all the incoming interns will use to become an immersed member of the Development Team. When I showed my boss what I had created, she was impressed with the thoroughness of the information and suggested that I help train the interns for the following year. "
As an intern leadership will not matter much but when it comes to your team you should be supportive to all other team members.
"As an intern there wasn't a lot of opportunity for leadership but countless opportunity to learn from other leaders. My mentors were incredible. Not only was I learning from mentors such as those in video production, but I was learning from other people throughout the company. C3 had these lunches called intern lunches and at each lunch somebody very important and high up in the company would talk to all the interns. They were leaders in their fields and they were incredible at their jobs. They talked about where they got and how they got there and what it takes to do what they do and to become a leader."
"As an intern your are pretty much at the bottom of the food chain. Leadership at this level is personal responsibility. Making sure you are to work on time, doing more than you are asked, and keeping a good attitude is what is really important. "
"As an intern, I served as a leader to student groups in Clemson. I consulted with the groups about what their objectives were and how they need to be tailored to ensure that we appropriately address global health issues and uphold our organization's values of accountability, service, and commitment. "
"As an intern, it was difficult to find leadership opportunities. But, I was lucky to fall under incredible leadership. My supervisor inspired and pushed for an entire rebranding for the company a few months before I started. This not only included the Marketing department but also the majority of the company would be experiencing major changes. But my supervisor saw it as a massive opportunity than a challenge and he took everyone's strengths and made a great work force to continuing to make it work. The company is still working through the changes but the way he lead and viewed everyone on the team is what created so much success. "

"As co-chair of the Diversity Committee, I helped acquire $5000 in funds for the department. This involved identifying a problem that the department needed help with and creating a presentation about it. Then my co-chair and I had to present this idea to a room full of select faculty and staff as well as outside donors in order to receive funding. This required the ability to communicate the need for this funding and the leadership skills to show that we would be able to handle the money effectively. "
As for mentioned in the previous competency of the project I had to execute as a leader for an afternoon while my supervisor was tied up with a deadline. I was able to encourage the team member who was helping us for the day and ask for her feedback and thoughts on the project. I was then able to share her ideas along with my own as we reported back to our supervisor with the updates on the project. This particular instance made me embrace the role of leader because I felt strongly about representing her thoughts as well as my own in a positive manner.
"As head of the community service committee, I wanted to collaborate on ideas to have a big project this semester. That is how we got to the idea of Habitat for humanity by getting my committee together to discuss ideas."
As I am still in the learning process I have not lead others in any large amounts. I have observed and learned from my mentor Mark's leadership skills. He helps keep colleagues on track by notifying them on problems and requesting periodic updates. He also presses 3rd party employees to meet deadlines and holds them accountable for not meeting them. (We had issues with programmers missing deadlines and switched to a different company)
"As I am working in a small company, we have a very interactive and friendly atmosphere. My seniors often discuss their project ideas with me and take my opinion into consideration. They also gave me the freedom to take my own decisions regarding certain graphic presentations even though they were probably different from their own style."
"As I briefly explained before, one of my more significant projects was to implement an embassy-wide security accountability system. After coordinating with the embassy in Amman, Jordan and our own IT department, we were able to get a beta-type system online. A huge part of this process was making sure that embassy employees knew what the system was and how to use it. To do this, I set up daily training sessions where employees could come and learn about the system and give their feedback. This required me to foster constructive dialogues about their viewpoints on the system and how we as an embassy could improve it."
"As I have mentioned in my answer regarding communication, I helped the team forming up the concept to break the loop of indecision and freeze the concept. Some assistance from my side helped them to complete their task and helped other teams to use the concept to make progress."
As I mentioned before we recently hired two new SEC's and last semester we hired another new SEC so now that we have three new girls I am one of the most experienced so I am finding myself becoming a leader to them. I am also a leader when I plan events with our clients because we have to help them make decisions.
"As I mentioned I was responsible for one of the projects at LANL over my internship and we often had meetings where we would discuss our project, goals and express our points of view."
"As I mentioned in the collaboration section, there was another intern with whom I worked closely. At the beginning of the semester I had the opportunity to lead as I was given the responsibility to inform her of various things that were happening in our programs as well as teach her how to work our database that we use for participant data."
"As I mentioned in the earlier competency, I was able to sit in on a team meeting where everyone's challenge documents were discussed and assessed. I was able to observe how my supervisor was able to capitalize on the group member's strengths and help member's when they needed it. Some of the group member's needed ideas on how to assess the groups during their challenge so that they could decide on a winner. My supervisor was able to ask another group member to share their rubric so that they could come up with their own rubric for their challenges. "

The new maintenance lead shares the same passion and vision for the makerspace as well as the knowledge to maintain the equipment."
"As mentioned above with regards to groups coming down for trips, myself as an intern was in charge of two specific groups that dealt with WASH education and the Center of Excellence group. I had different meetings that I was a part of and also when just talking to the group themselves I had to take leadership because I had the expertise and knowledge of what truly will work in Haiti and what would be better conceptually. This did not mean that I was condescending to the groups, because all opinions are valid and all thoughts are valid, but I helped in guiding from large over scaled ideas/pathways for the projects to things that are more obtainable here in Haiti and back in Clemson."
"As mentioned above, I lead a project at my work place called Power BI dashboard creation which requires a joint effort from many engineers. Originally being my idea, very often I empower and motivate people to get tasks done. "
"As mentioned before, my project team consists of software developers, project managers and user experience personnel. As evident, the different background of the team members requires special attention to communication in order to obtain alignment. As the UX person on the team, it was imperative that I keep the rest of the team involved in the process. Other team members were invited to all UX activities and while this helped, there were some gaps in understanding how this contributed to the projects moving forward. In order bridge this gap, a meeting was organized where I presented UX tasks and their corresponding implications to the project with visuals which would be most effective for a cross-functional team. This helped the team understand the need for and importance of UX and it's contribution to efficiently completing the project. "
"As mentioned before, writers, photographers, and copy editors worked together alongside me in order to reach the common goal of a finished UPIC magazine. "
"As mentioned in the Communication and Collaboration competencies, I had to work with a diverse team of individuals (from Quality directors to line operators) to improve the IQC process. An example would involve listening to varying viewpoints from three IQC inspectors and the manager on how the reporting application interface should look like, and developing a friendly interface also considering the changes that may occur in the future. I had to incorporate the manager and directors’ inputs into the final reporting template as well, having to explain my decisions using data, thus having everyone conform to a common viewpoint."
"As mentioned in the responsibilities , I was leading the Conversion projects that involved conversion of all dashboards developed in SAP into something visually attractive and user friendly using Microsoft Power BI. So all these dashboards that I had created were going to be outsourced to users and customers and I responsible initially presenting these dashboards to the executive and then to the stakeholders. It was a challenging task because , it was concerning the users and as we know each user has a different requirement . So coming up with something that satisfied everyone's need was difficult yet important."
"As mentioned previously, I served as the leader of a open discussion about our visibility. This was something I requested we talk about during the agenda for the meeting, and wanted to see all interns have a stake in. "
"As mentioned, my work in leadership related with the intern project allowed me to work forward facing with many other individuals and help them coordinate efforts to ensure we had a great presentation."
"As mentors, we have weekly group meetings with all of the other mentors and Ms. Lisa. During the meetings we always go through information of the week such as events coming up, information to pass along to our mentees, or a guest speaker. I input my opinion or provide insight on certain topics such as things pertaining to my major, Chemical Engineering. I am also one of the only two hispanic mentors so sometimes I have a different point of view on things and how we can help the hispanic mentees such as when we talked about DACA. "
"As my immediate day-to-day supervisor would assign and divide tasks, he often assigned work that fit within my strengths or was just outside of my comfort level. In this way, I was able to gradually improve and expand my expertise."

As part of our training our supervisor and department had representatives from Clemson SAGA (Sexuality and Gender Alliance) come in and speak with all of the mentors to share their experiences about their life and with coming out. This was training for us in order to be prepared if ever a mentee came to us to discuss anything related to this. I thought this showed great leadership as well as helped us to further open up our personal perspectives. 
"As part of the sustainability cross-cutting team, I held several meetings from time to time to help realize system-level objectives in our team. "

"As president of the study abroad interns for my fourth and final semester, I definitely demonstrated leadership more than at any other point during my last three semesters. I was in charge of organizing and communicating with interns, connecting them for various events. For instance, I was able to further my leadership and group coordination skills by organizing interns for several meetings, event sign ups and even the end of semester dinner. I established and utilized programs including GroupMe and Doodle Poll to make this possible. I had to make many adjustments to these events in order to cater to the needs of the interns. In doing so, I helped to create a healthy and well-oiled work environment."
"As previously mentioned, I became a bit of a poster child for Give Day. By taking on this role, my duties far extended past simply the Shirley Center for Philanthropy. Instead, friends and peers began asking me questions about the cause because of my promotions. I was able to tell them about the efforts of Give Day and explain the importance of the Office of Development. I only played a very small role in the grand scheme of things, but sharing my work with others gave me a sense of purpose. Many people also followed up with me about the results and I was proud to report back to them that we had exceeded all expectations thanks to their support. "
"As previously mentioned, I worked with both the creative and project management teams. These teams had different goals.Creative wanted to spend however much money is necessary to achieve a creative vision. Project management wanted to include as much creative scope as possible while putting priority on budget and schedule. Since I worked with both teams, they would both come to me with their concerns and I would help work with these teams to come to a compromise that would benefit the overall goal of the company."
"As previously mentioned, I worked with other employees on our “Celebrate Safely” campaign in order to make improvements and update our educational messages for the upcoming school year. Not only were we able to come to a conclusion on our vision, but I also communicated these accomplishments and this process to one of my health classes this semester in a presentation on intervention strategies for college drinking."
"As stated in the collaboration section, I feel as though I stepped up this semester and encouraged collaboration and participation from everyone"

"As the intern who has worked here the longest, Ashley has entrusted me with helping other interns to complete their assignments. "
"As the intern with the most experience in the lab, I was seen in a slightly higher position than some other student workers simply because I had the most experience when dealing with the printing press or other workplace problems. On Fridays when many students would be working, after a press run I would informally gather everybody and discuss what tasks needed to be completed and each person would volunteer their wants or dislikes of tasks and we would all work together to delegate our to-do list to get the lab cleaned on time."
"As the lead for social media, I had to instruct people on my goals and how I needed their help in conducting a successful social media presence."
"As the lead on the CU Navigate app, I took on a significant amount of responsibility.

These small task were always left up to me because as a leader you have to be prepared at all times. "

With that in mind, over the course of the semester, a lot of the events that FIRST held were planned by the student org, so being the intern helped the communication between the director and the student org. There were multiple meetings held, and I led them and made sure that everyone on the committee was able to voice their opinion, and that their point of view was discussed. Through these meetings, we were able to organize and implement multiple successful fundraisers, the retreat, and multiple social events to bring the students closer together. "

"As treasurer, its my job (as well as the president and chief of staff) to create the budget for the fiscal year. To do this, we needed to plan out our allocations and figure out where the money goes.

"At my internship my mentor wanted me to come up with a way to get Clemson students to apply to be camp counselors. I used my leadership skills to brainstorm a way to get Clemson students excited about this opportunity and align these students objectives to our organizational objectives. I decided that the best way to do this would be interviewing previous counselors and sharing their experience in a newsletter, and then sharing this newsletter on our social media platforms. Students use social media and would be sure to see this message and it would encourage them to apply to be a counselor. This drew in great engagement on our social media platforms and to the program as a whole. "
"At my internship with CAPS I work with another intern. We would collaborate a lot of different projects. For the tabling event for October we had to come up with creative ways to raise awareness for domestic violence. Our mentor suggested we give out pens on library bridge; however, my coworker thought stickers would be better considering college students use them more often. I encouraged my coworker to tell our mentor that the stickers had a potential to be better for reaching students.

In the end we ended up using the stickers for our tabling event instead of pens. "

It was interesting to see how people with certain experiences could provide a more potential help for this group than others. "
"At our last meeting of the semster, our site mentor asked each of the student interns what he could do for next semester to make us more able to do our jobs. As we gave him ideas, he wrote them down. I thought that this was an excellent way to lead a group, especially a group of people who are younger and who are just part-time interns. It made us feel that he was committed to helping us to succeed and that he was open to hearing our ideas."

This was extremely helpful in allowing me to get closer to achieving my goal of finishing the app."

"At the beginning of every day, the entire team gathers for a daily meeting. Although I was often not present for the meetings considering my position was part time, there were a handful of days in which I attended this daily meeting. At each meeting the staff discusses the state of the members, addressing if the member is a concern or stable, which allowed the case managers to then have a good understanding of the progress of the members they were seeing that day. When I was present at these meetings, I would often ask questions that would prompt my supervisor and case workers to delve into greater detail about the state of the member. The purpose of these questions were to enhance my understanding as I was the newest addition to the team. However, these questions also lead the staff into sharing different view points on the progress of the member, and further analysis of their recovery, as their recovery is the ultimate goal. "
"At the beginning of my internship we mostly worked on assembling trap arrays and trap maintenance, and The work was very tedious and taxing. This often required us to go out in groups of three or more with my supervisor and other volunteers from various backgrounds.

"At the beginning of the semester, our mentors would tend to put the new interns on easier tasks such as lighting in order to get us acclimated to the job while the graduate students worked on harder tasks. As the year progressed, us interns worked more with the graduate students on harder tasks to learn how to complete them. This was a great way of delegating tasks and helping us learn effectively. "
"At the beginning of the semester, our office gathered for a ""Think Tank"" meeting where our goal was to brainstorm as many areas and ideas for improvement as we possibly could. One of my ideas was to increase the ability for students to contact successful alumni.

"At the end of November, my partner and I with a few members of the water team traveled to the village of Morne Michel where previous interns had worked and where CEDC is planning to work in the future. Due to the eighteen-month between the last set of interns and myself in May of this year, all information possessed by CEDC on Morne Michel was at least eighteen months old. I arranged for and organized our trip to the village to re-establish our connection with the community and to achieve the goals for the trip we'd set before we departed (including the completion of a land survey, gathering of GPS points of water sources of interest around the village, and retrieving test-able samples of this water for fecal coliforms.) Though pressed for time toward the end of our visit, we accomplished each of our objectives, compiled the information and reported to our site mentor and the group in Clemson working on the development plan for the village. CEDC has worked previously with a church in Columbia which has agreed to sponsor work in the village to whom after the information gathered has been further compiled with potential solutions will be presented.

We were both in charge of four coloring pages, which made the task more achievable."
"At the farm, this is a heavy requirement. In order to clean out a lot of the now empty pens, especially in House 2, we had to pull together the staff members and take each of their ideas on how to efficiently clean the space.

"Back to the collaboration example from Forest Fest, I had to organize members from my sampling club to come and help with the event. I am the president of that club, so I am often in charge of organizing events, getting students to come out and help, how things should be set up for anything we need to present, etc. and for Forest Fest, I had to recruit the members, tell them what needed to be done once we got there to make sure we had the best range of macroinvertebrates to present to the kids, encourage the younger members to communicate with not only the parents and adults but also the eager children and the younger ones who don't understand quite as much. "
"Based on my research objective I formulated a set of methodologies and shared them with my mentor and fellow interns. They were supportive towards my ideas. At times my mentor could rely on me over a few technical issues when he could not manage time to work with the team due to his busy schedule, and gradually I became an active decision-maker in the specific project that responded well to my pre-defined methodologies."

"Before the beginning of every semester, the CEDC Board of Directors takes a retreat to discuss goals for the semester as they align with the goals of our organization over all. This semester, I decided to break up this day of dialogue and planning into two parts: Strategic Planning and Semester Planning, and I broke up these sessions into two days. This allowed for us to have discussions about the organizational goals in 3,5, and 10 years from now as well as discuss big-picture opportunities. Then in the semester planning session, we were able to bring these long-term ideas into the perspective of what could be executed within a semester. As Program Director, I had to plan and conduct these meetings as well as facilitate discussion. I centered the dialogue around our mission statement and pushed for us to develop a revised vision statement that would help the organization move forward. Then, I helped the board direct their thoughts about the upcoming semester in light of what our long term goals were determined to be. Our organization works internationally and serves the specified needs of a rural community, so our objectives are global ones and often align perfectly with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. For this reason, I also made the efforts this semester to incorporate lessons about the SDGs into our Creative Inquiry course so that students could be knowledgeable about why we are doing the work that we are doing. Each project, each task must align with the mission statement, so it has been vital in all meetings and classes this semester to bring the group back to our mission statement. It is our foundation and keeps us grounded when other things may be changing. The drafted vision statement helped us choose a direction for the semester and for the near and long-term future. "

We have an operations intern who has really stepped up to the challenge and done a great job delegating roles to us on game days to make sure every part of the ballpark is up and ready to go prior to game time. While he realizes he cannot do it all alone, he also takes the time to show each of us how to set up each particular part of the stadium to avoid having to go back and fix it later. While this can sometimes seem tedious he knows doing it ahead of time will help things run smoothly in the long run. "

"Buddy (David) and I have noted phenomenon in our BSF vermicompost bins that led to the idea of starting an experimental design. While I had typed up the frame, Buddy and I both discussed how the experiment would be conducted. We went over what materials we needed and what we could use, where to do the experiment, I noted small factors that could impact the results like larvae concentration and temperature while he had ideas on making what were essentially mini pods that would function the same as the main pod we had outside so that we wouldn't interrupt their reproductive cycle. Once the design is finalized, we will conduct the experiment, and we have high hopes that the results will support our hypothesis and make a monumental impact of the separation of contaminants from the organic waste products collected for compost around the country. It's a very niche but incredible theory I would never have had the chance to formulate without Buddy's help and encouragement, and hope we will be able to take our findings to the annual Compost Conference in January.

I have learned that these clinicians must remain calm and level headed and must be sensitive to the diverse backgrounds and needs of all clients. CAPS runs many therapy groups every week.

"During my internship, I was asked to attend a monthly safety meeting that involved all engineering managers and engineering foreman at the four textiles facilities. At one of the meetings, we had to make a decision on how to proceed with a particular form of Lock Out, Tag Out (LOTO) within the facility. The way we had been doing it for a while wasn't working the way it was originally intended to we wanted to amend the way it was used for better results. Instead of the managerial staff leading the meeting, the foreman on each shift were asked to lead this particular meeting because they were the ""on the floor"" experts who used it every day. The managers and I still expressed our opinions, but they were able to guide us and teach us the way they thought the program should be implemented."
"During my internship, I was discussing a fellow intern's product with them, and realized that they required 3D designed and printed parts.

"During my internship, I witnessed by supervisor often seek assistance from other faculty members. I also saw other faculty come to my supervisor for assistance, because she was often in the know of what was going on. This made me realize that each person has their own strengths and while it's easy to be envious of others, it's wiser to build them up and recognize that they are more adept to certain skills. For instance, one faculty member is not technologically savvy, but I was able to help troubleshoot their issues. On a different note, my supervisor is very familiar with car maintenance and was able to help me find an inexpensive solution to my car troubles. Although somewhat personal, it's still clear that each person has their talents, and this internship has helped me realize the benefits of seeking others' expertise rather than trying to do it all yourself."

We shared ideas and discussed potential funding options, and now we have a creative inquiry for this Spring to finalize the selection of this hardware and procure it!"
"During my internship, our department had several meetings where we discussed payroll topics. As a new set of eyes, I was able to provide a different viewpoint to those who have certain opinions. For example, a group in our department were discussing a more improved way of pulling W-2s for tax season. It used to be hectic because there would be several lists and hands touching them, which would create confusion and backtracking.

My fellow intern and I had to use resources that we had on hand in order to come up with a make shift chlorinator that would allow us to treat the water, and then we had to share this idea with the other members of our water team in Haiti. We spent time explaining our vision so that we could get it properly installed. In the end, it was a success and my mentor was very impressed with our work and asked me to write an article about what we had done. I published the article on LinkedIn where our program supporters were able to read it and give feedback. The article was very well received which made me feel really good about the work we had been able to do. "

"During the summer camp for 7th and 8th graders, I had to make sure that each student was able to express themselves and had fun while still learning at camp. I asked each individual student if they were enjoying camp and making sure that they were listening to their counselors and taking them to class. I had to make sure that each class that they went to was interactive and made sure to get the students feedback and then relay this information to my supervisor through leading a discussion meeting about the feedback."
"During the summer scholars week, I was assigned a group of students to take through the facility and teach. Some of the experiments we had them do involved analyzing different samples to find certain qualities and characteristics. To keep the students involved, I had them do it themselves after being taught how the instruments worked. I had my group discuss ways to find what they were looking for on the sample and then figure out which one worked faster than the others. Seeing them throw out different ideas and discuss the pros and cons of each to determine which one would work best showed me that I had chosen an effective route to introduce them to the kind of research that is done in the facility."
"During the summer, I had the experience of teaching a group of food service workers in Anderson County nutrition basics while they were at a cooking camp. I saw them learn, share their stories and assessed them in their knowledge that led to an increased group knowledge of nutrition and the passion to serve children the most nutritious food as possible."

"During the UPIC retreat, we were working in groups to discuss the best way in which we could assemble the UPIC positions book so that it would be a meaningful, easy-to-navigate arrangement with descriptions, competencies, and interests listed for the different positions. In the group, I found that just speaking up was in itself a form of leadership because it then encouraged more dialogue from my team members, including a newer team member that just got to Clemson the week before. This way, more dialogue was created, and we were all able to come together and agree on an effective layout for that book."
"During the Utilization data collection my mentor, Lydia Krause, had to organize all of the interns into time slots so that the data could be collected around each interns class time schedule. This leadership helped the data collection be split as evenly as possible between the interns and herself, and also allowed the data to be collected in a reasonable time manner."
"During the weekends, it is very easy for the counselors to get tired and want to just watch campers do the activities. It was my responsibility to remind/encourage them to participate and engage with their campers throughout the entire weekend."
During the weekly meetings between interns and our supervisor I had the chance to discuss different solutions for the projects I was working on. I found the other individuals' feedbacks extremely constructive and helpful.
"During the weekly mentor meetings with our advisor, I observed her deligate tasks to certain individuals based on their strenghts. "
"During these two weeks, my mentor is out for vacation, so I'm in charge of the entire Mail UX research.

I perfectly finish all these tasks without any help from my mentor."
"During this internship, I pushed some of the 4-H'ers that were working with my mentor as well this summer as 4-H interns. Each of these were homeschooled kids and some had different religious backgrounds. These interns had goals planned for the summer that they wanted to accomplish. I would sit in my office or go into different rooms in the office with them and push them to work hard to where they could reach their goals.

During trials I would take the lead when people had questions about the lab or about our roles in the lab.
"During weekly group meetings, I would sometimes sense that some of our team members weren’t happy with how certain articles were coming along. I would ask them their opinions on these things, so they could feel freer to open up about their ideas. This caused use to be able to openly discuss the magazine as a whole, and let the writers have a say in the design, and the designers even have a say in how some of the articles were written. Our common goal is the complete the magazine and make it the best it can be, and I think these discussions helped us achieve that."
"During weekly lab meetings, my lab mates and Dr. Alper would sit with me and we would bounce ideas, problems, and solutions, off of one another so that we could see the problems from all angles. A few times it was my idea that was the solution and it led to making an advancement in lab protocol and in the project itself."
"During weekly meetings with the Transfer Agency, I was delegated the responsibility of recording the minutes. With this job function, I was able to review monthly goals and find where the team most needed to apply efforts in order to satisfy deadlines. Through discovering areas of attention, I promoted discussion between my team members and set priorities for the following week. Meeting shared goals and clarifying the vision was a satisfying responsibility."

During WOW Jr. I had to encourage the students to form answers on the topics we discussed to ensure they were actively learning. 
"Each day at work we started off with a morning meeting. These meetings were used to give us whatever information we might need for the day, but also to help bring us together as a team. We announce if it’s anyone’s birthday, ask if anyone has something fun planned for the weekend, and have a joke of the day. My leadership team does a great job of making coworkers feel more like family which helps us all be united to achieve our goals."
"Each day I observe my supervisors lead the team to a common goal. The team I intern with is very collaborative in that while their are supervisors, a whole initiative and project would not be completed without the work and dedication of the whole team. There are a lot of moving parts to each project that provide each individual with a task, leading to the overall goal of the team and the project. "
Each intern regularly rotated into a leadership position where we were expected to share our own experience with the work we were doing in a way that could benefit the work of the other interns.

Each semester our mentor helps us each develop individual learning goals and uses each of these together alongside our individual strengths to make the pressroom operate more smoothly. 
Each semester we are required to lead our team meeting in discussion where we assign articles to read and give a presentation to the group. 
"Each Spring PEER holds an event known as SEE Clemson where high school seniors come tour the campus and learn more about the PEER program and for this event my supervisor put together groups of students to fulfill the roles of tour guides, panelists, and runners. I feel like this falls under the Awareness in the leadership category because she had to know the strengths of each individual to know where to properly place them in order to have a successful event."
"Each Thursday my mentor and his boss have a meeting to discuss current projects and future strategy. Each time, I try to bring forth ideas and open them up for discussion to see what Ryan and Dustin think, and to come up with the best solution for what we're trying to plan or solve."

"
"Each week one of the coaches comes in to give his idea for the graphic that will go on that week's game plan. He evaluates the team's performance at the game the weekend before and evaluates the strengths in our opponent and creates a theme to empower the team. While we produce the graphic image of the phrase, theme, or idea, he enstills it in the players. Going into Senior Night and Military Appreciation Week, his theme was ""Band of Brothers"" and encouraging teamwork and encouragement throughout the team. Seeing the coach use a single phrase to lead the team to an overall goal for that week was excellent observation of accomplishing a shared goal. "
Each week we have an event team meeting where everyone in our department who works directly with clients or events comes together and we talk about ways to make our events work fully as the client expects it to and how to make it work in the most efficient way for our staff. We all really challenge each other and everyone talks and thinks outside the box. 
"Earlier this semester, I decided to rework how i organized photos on my computer. This allowed me to be able to process photos much faster, and make sure that they were achieved correctly. I also took some time to create a document in which will allow interns to navigate the photo archive quickly, since I struggled with this at the beginning of the semester. "
"Earlier, in the semester, a guest speaker came to Clemson and two of my fellow interns and I had to produce two highlight videos about it for the Clemson social media channels. Before we went there, I made sure we got together to think of a game plan for how we wanted to handle the shoot. "

"Every Friday my group had team meetings in which we would go over our work since the last week, as well as ongoing assignments. Initially I was not that quick to share about what I was working on because I’d assumed nobody would want to hear about my low-level projects. However, as the summer went on, I came to realize the value in sharing during these meetings and just hearing what others had to say, because the different viewpoints almost always were helpful. In this way the individual goals of the group became a common goal that we were all helping each other with."
"Every meeting I ask a safety question. These questions never have one correct answer, and when everyone adds their own opinion on the matter, we all can reach a common goal in writing the rule or procedure for the certain safety topic."
Every meeting there are decisions that need to be taken. Proposing ideas and listening to others suggestions is very important.

"
"Every month my department holds a ""Creative Hour"" where we break into groups of five and try and work through specific issues our department has brought up. Last month my group was tasked with looking for a way to establish standard assumptions when creating simulations. I brought up my experience formulating a simulation without these assumptions and opened up a conversation with a colleague who had not yet started hers. In the end I believe we reached some actionable conclusions and presented them to the rest of the department. "
Every monthly meeting to the entire staff and weekly meetings with the supervisory staff I address all issues in the shop with equipment and safety and assemble somewhat of a shopping list of goals and items to better the shop by the next meeting.

I was able to offer an alternative perspective as I student and younger person. "
Every other week my department held a meeting with all the interns and our mentor to discuss what we've each individually been working on and what our goals are for the upcoming weeks.

"Every time I complete a design project, I send it to multiple people on the team and ask them if they have any thoughts on how it could be improved. After receiving feedback from my team, I send it to my client. I detail the changes I've made or I detail my design project, and I ask for a second level of feedback. Through this process, I receive a lot of different feedback to make the best product possible."
"Every time we work we work under other employees at ITC. Every day i see these employees assign different interns to different tasks so that all the tasks are completed on time. Interns with more software experience are assigned to the software portion of fixing the servers, where as those with more hardware knowledge are assigned to the hardware side."
"Every time, before we start a new project, we always setup lots of meeting to discuss about how to design this project and also during the meeting our manager or tech leader will lead us toward achieving the goal."
Every Tuesday we would have the social media meeting in which the videographers would meet with the social media team and we would discuss content. In this meeting we shared ideas and encouraged discussion about different content ideas. 
"Every two weeks, an intern is given the peer award, which recognizes their work. I was given the award one week and got to choose the next recipient of the award.

We covered many topics such as test anxiety, time management, connecting to Clemson, and stress relief, to name a few. As a leader, I had to empower students to be successful during their bridge year in order to reach their goal of bridging to Clemson next fall. "
Every week my lab group has a lab meeting and the primary investigator (lab leader/director/my mentor) asks everyone in our group of about 15 people to update all of us on their work and asks what their future directions are and provided suggestions and advice to aid them in their work. He also helped make connections by providing useful contacts to everyone in the group to help further their work and by drawing connections between the different members of the group.
Every week we had a meeting with Dr.Putman to discuss activities at the camps and upcoming opportunities. I think I learned leadership skills by helping lead these weekly meetings. 
"Every week we would have meetings to discuss updates on the Makerspace operations but also ideas and solutions to making the Makerspace operate more efficiently. We would all propose ideas to improve the space and as a group we would decide if it would be a effective solution to our problem.

Everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses. During my internship I was consistently working with clients because the firm recognized that I have good social skills. Other interns specialized in other tasks that they were much better at than me. Every successful organization tailors employees assignments to their strengths.
"Everyone in the lab group is working on the same projects, but we all work on different sub projects. These individual assignments are assigned by my boss based on our strengths, technical expertise, and experience in the subject. He also made sure to ask me beforehand if I felt interested in this project, believing that I will do my best work if I actually like the work. He also understood that I am learning and often pointed me in a good starting direction. All this gave me confidence that I can successfully accomplish the task. "
"Everyone in the lab is proficient in a certain area. Some of us are better at 3D modeling, while others are better at Illustrator. Because of this, Dr. Ullmer would split large projects into components and distribute them according to our strengths. He also often paired us together so that we can learn from each other. I learned 3D modeling because of this and others learned Arduino programming from me. "
"Everyone of our workers has a certain strength that should be utilized to most efficiently perform our tasks. I organized the other interns on a phase implementation project to ensure the project was done quickly. 1 intern was set on labeling cables, 1 was set on running them, and 1 was set on implementing the hardware."
"Everyone who works in the parlor has a different way of doing it, so learning from everyone and following different people to get the job done was something I did every week"

For most the time I was responsible for closing the WATT center IT department. This involved a great deal of leadership since there was not ever a supervisor to watch over me. I had to quickly learn the functions of the building incase I was asked a question from someone.
"For my internship, I used leadership skills when I helped lead a meeting between two full-time members and another intern to go over my project and the next steps looking at the requirements of the task and draw out an agreed upon solution. For this meeting, we all shared our different ideas which were respected and discussed."
"For my internship, one of my projects was the Ag Ed ""Teach Ag"" recruitment campaign.

I was able to communicate different resources, opportunities, and my own experiences to help them begin to achieve that goal at their time here at Clemson."
"For my project, I needed substantial help moving tanks and tubs, recording data, and filtering. I was working with idividuals who had their own projects to focus on, so I had to explain what I expected/needed and listened when we ran into obstacles. They needed to know I was grateful for their help and that they were doing a great job, and that their ideas were greatly appreciated and helped us move past any hiccups."
"For NPHC: Fall Fest Step Show, I had a meeting with my client and with a few people from our operations staff. I helped the client convey what type of tech he wanted for his event. I also helped the operations staff give input and have them collaborate to figure out the best way to proceed with the event. I then divided the jobs among our group so that we could get everything done efficiently based on each person's skills."
"For one of my data analysis projects, I created a tableau dashboard. I was required to highlight the use of the dashboard to some of the members of the business. To advertise the tool, I explained the benefit that the tool would reduce the amount of analysis my team members would have to do offline. Additionally, having all of the data in one place allows the entire business to be aligned instead of everyone pulling different reports."
For one small project we were working on we needed to install a new ice maker. The important inputs to an ice maker are electricity and water. We were trying to determine the best location for this ice maker in one of the labs so that we could easily access the water and electrical lines. I was able to give my 2 cents on where I believed we should install the ice maker based on the utilities that I could see.

"For the festivals I helped with, we needed ideas for things to hand out and things to do at the festival for the everyone. I helped get a group of people together, many of whom were going to be at the festival helping, to discuss different ideas. I made sure everyone got a chance to give their different ideas and opinions on all the ideas stated. I also made sure that everyone was in agreement on the final ideas for the festival."
"For the first project, I worked at a client site and had to request team members to do certain tasks for me to time. This was hard to do as not all the team members were on board with what my company was doing, and they did not necessarily want to do an extra task. To avoid this issue, I would gather team members at the start of the day, and explain to them my role. This ""elevator speech"" always included how my work is solely to help you in the long run. This was a good strategy to make sure everyone was on the same page and give them a little motivation to help me complete my job. I wouldn't say I necessarily led them, as they had to perform the tasks on their own, but I gathered the team together. "
For the glue gun project I had to communicate with all the operators in each cell to take feedback for the staple gun. This helped me to understand the problem they face regularly and think about how to overcome them. This was the time where I encouraged discussion where individuals could share their point of view to achieve a common goal.
"For the intern project we were given, me and the other design intern were in charge of all the design work for the project which turned out being the majority of the final product. When it came to this part of the project, the other interns really turned toward us and let us take charge. Not only were we given the freedom to make all of our own ideas but a lot of the other facets of the project stemmed from our ideas. We allowed other interns to contribute to the collaboration of ideas and facilitated the process of making one cohesive project that incorporates all of our ideas. "

"For the majority of my time at Padcelona, I worked within teams to accomplish goals. A huge part of working with teams is to share different points of views and hear each other out. For one project, I was pitching an idea for motivating people during events. I talked about both the pros and cons of my idea and asked for feedback. My coworkers were respectful yet still were not afraid to offer suggestions for improvement, which was great. We drew new diagrams so that we could see the change that was happening just during our conversation, and it was a very successful meeting."
"For the Rhondda Thomas project, I gathered my team members together to discuss ideas surrounding the Book of Names and the spring event. After we met, I compiled our ideas into an email and updated Dr. Thomas on our progress and shared our ideas with her. "

"Frequently during this semester different individuals at my office would send emails to everyone in the office recognizing the achievements of other coworkers. One specific example was about 2 weeks ago when a coworker was promoted to a managerial position. A chain email was sent to everyone in the office and multiple coworkers responded congratulating the advancement and wishing the individual good luck, which represents the acknowledgement of achievements within the organization."
"From our daily meetings I observed Bill (my onsite supervisor). i have rarely seen a more approachable manager but he still conveys his point. On a lot of my previous teams i have observed people hiding problems, this was much open. I didn't have much leadership opportunities, as I was not managing anyone directly. "
"From the beginning when I first joined the team at Madren Center, the supervisors encourage all of us to look towards our goal for the end of the semester. They encouraged all of us to challeneg ourselves and to not be afraid to ask questions. "

General support of others in the office in order to allow them to achieve their goals by contributing to projects in any way I could so that they would be successful
"Given the nature of my internship being team-based this semester, myself and my partner had a common goal of success. I already knew the expectations, processes and overall vision that was assigned to us, but my partner didn't. My first step was getting her onboard with the vision of what Dr. Hannon expected from us and laying out a plan of how to get there over the semester."
"Going over the Fashion Show Idea, expressing my vision and goal for the show to others whether it was for CCPD or clubs and organizations to get them to understand and want to help out. "

"Having the high school student in lab helped a lot for my competencies. I had to empower her to take control of the project that she was working on, but also provide insight and guidance so that she was not completely on her own. "

Helping to guide other interns in an open forum with ideas for there own separate programing
Hosted several meetings to discuss and solve issues.
"I accompanied my internship supervisor, Morris Warner, to many different meetings for the Cattleman's association. Morris is heavily involved with this association and often presents on various topics and helps organize their events. While I have been attending these meetings, It became clear to me that beef production techniques vary among every producer. Each individual has their own unique ways of doing things that range from rotational grazing to administering vaccines. I noticed that Mr. Warner spends a large amount of time talking with the producers involved in this association to gain a wide range of knowledge. He is very open to considering different methods of production and learning which techniques work best. A specific example that I observed comes from a local beef producer who is also a member of this association. Many of the producers from older generations are stuck in their ways when it comes to rotational grazing. This specific producer has used research and scientific evidence to develop his intensive grazing management practices in an effort to cut down on internal parasite populations. He feeds virtually no hay to his cows, unlike many of the other producers. By keeping his cows on pastures for usually less than a week and allowing the grass to maintain longer lengths, this producer has found a way to disrupt the life cycle of the parasites that often present issues beef cattle. The producer has consistently seen much lower populations of internal parasites after applying these methods of rotational grazing. I have observed Morris take this information and share it with others at the cattleman's association meetings, even going so far as to organize a meeting at this producer's farm to have him share his successful methods with others. Morris recently purchased a few cows of his own and plans to use these new rotational grazing methods. This method is different from what he grew up doing at his father's beef farm. I believe this showcases his leadership and ability to capitalize and benefit from another's point of view. "
"I acted as a leader on the farm during each shift that I worked because of the independence involved. I had to feed calves on my own time and without assistance from other employees, so I had to have a good sense of understanding of my duties and use my own judgment while working on my own. I had to be a leader when training another part-time student employee, and also when I had to take the initiative to find someone to switch shifts with me when I was unable to work a certain day."
"I acted on behalf of Clemson internal communications when determining how to frame a story about Tiger Advocates. I had to relay the ideas and limitations that internal communications had to the people working to publicized Tiger Advocates, and then had to work with them to craft the story."
I added a section to each week's meetings where interns could discuss any problems or ideas they've had about the space. This would allow us to share ideas and solutions to common problems. 
I aided the team in developing a plan for the design review number 2 and presented the plan to the stakeholders.
I aligned the faculty of the SMCC to achieve the goal of future profitability by providing them with tools and resources to jumpstart their off campus consulting branch. 
"I always asked questions that would lead to the best articles written with passion and knowledge, but one particular instance I was not getting as much of a response so I opened up the floor for more general discussion which then made the person more comfortable with my position as an intern to then share information. "
I always encourage my clients to give me as much feedback as possible because ultimately it is my job to make sure their vision comes across in the project. 
I always encouraged my teammates to think systematically so that each and every argument could be done systematically and productive outputs can be obtained from the discussion.
I always try to take the lead on projects and I enjoy public speaking and leading the Aspire class in discussion.
I am able to communicate group accomplishments to the board of trustees indirectly by helping prepare quarterly updates from Lean team members. 
I am able to lead others. If I am working on a task I am able to delegate responsibilities to others.
"I am accounts receivable analyst, and my lead is Katy Outen. She devotes herself on everything about billing. She arrives at location at 6 a.m everyday, and leaves at 4pm. She answered our questions very specifically and in detail. She is a good lead at billing."
I am always observing Dr. Dobbins express leadership within his meetings. He always presents the issue with respect to those around the issue and/or those who could be impacted by it. He keeps a calm meeting room to promote solutions within the group. 
"I am always the one to take initiative when we are brain-storming as a group. For example, what workshops we should apply to next semester to better the program, and things of the like. "
I am an entry level of the project so I don’t have the lead experience at all. 
"I am constantly watching Mrs. Serita and Mrs. Lisa, observing the way they interact with the mentors and everyone who enters the PEER/WISE office. I observe how Mrs. Serita leads her office staff into a discussion of further enhancing the efforts of the PEER/WISE office resources and the staff."
I am currently in the process of training and communicating our goals as Inside Clemson to the new intern for next semester. I have also communicated with other current interns to establish one common voice throughout Clemson's media. 
"I am not directly over any other employees. However, as a manger, I work with many employees in our department for each event. We are adding more people and changing some of our processes. If I see a problem with one of my events or if I notice that there is confusion about something, I try to make sure that it is addressed and fixed for next time."
I am responsible for designing and implementing an efficient data ecosystem. My code runs at the heart of CEVAC because my coworkers’ scripts reference my tables and require reliable data. 
"I am technically above over 8 people on the CEDC organization chart, which at one time would've scared me. Now, I feel comfortable delegating work and trusting my teammates, to the point where I am now taking on a large leadership role next semester as Assistant Program Director."
"I am the Assistant Program Director, it is my job to serve in assisting groups in determining objectives for the semester, and making sure that they are on task to meet their goals. Along with that I work with the other directors and make sure that project objectives are headed in the direction that will benefit the organization."
"I am the committee head of the community service committee in PEER/WISE. As one of the heads, we decided to come up with a list of events that we would want to do. To make sure that these got approved, we met up with the department head and communicated our ideas. We also worked with our committee so that they would help out with the project as well."
I am the main channel for the students to talk to about the study abroad program. I also run the Rosetta Stone programming so I am the point of contact with any issues about that.
I am the oldest of the interns and they all look to me to guide them when starting task and ask me to evaluate them upon completion. 
"I am the senior intern for the facility, so it is my role to lead the other interns. I teach them all of the tasks they need to do and explain to them our goals at the facility so that we can all team up and try to reach them together."
I arrange the time for discussion and team-work measurement. We will argue on the encountering problem and try to find the supportive evidence to convince each other. 
I asked as many questions as I could becuase i had never even heard of 4-H before 
"I asked for my seniors' opinions about increasing work performance rate. In return, I gave my suggestions as to how wastage can be reduced."
I asked my fellow peers for feedback during our decision making so that we could make decisions that represented their interests
I asked my interns what they wish was different about the process and got feedback which was later implemented.
I asked my mentor to schedule a meeting and invite some experts from the company to discuss some issues in our project. I was able to lead the meeting and ask everyone to give me his opinion on my work. Everyone provide different points but all of them was helpful and help me to improve my work and solve some problems.
I assisted in leading the Business in Paris program since I had been on the program and had been the one in the office with the most experience relevant to it. I took on the role to focus on visa applications and as a guide before and during the orientation process in Paris.
"I assisted in organizing a knowledge college by brainstorming topic ideas, organization strategies, people to utilize and other details. "
I assisted my mentor in a meeting for the new Clemson Home website in which my opinion as a student led to more discussion on design choices and offered a different point of view for the layout of the website.
I assisted my supervisor in answering questions about how these technologies can be beneficial in nursing to groups of nursing students that came in the lab to experience the technologies for class. 
I attempted to plan a field day and reached out to other committees to have everyone work together towards a common objective. 
I attended 2 meetings a month where I would meet with the whole instruction team about everything that was happening in Cooper Library. Everyone worked together to improve the service desk at Cooper Library and kept everyone updated on ideas and gave feedback. Everyone at Cooper Library treats others with respect. 
"I attended a yearly HR meeting to recognize the accomplishments of fiscal year 2019 and set goals for fiscal year 2020. The first half of the meeting was all about recognizing and appreciating employees for their work in the previous fiscal year. I thought the chief human resource officer, Emily, did a great job of making everyone feel recognized and appreciated so they knew their work was meaningful and valuable. I thought this was also a great way to motivate employees to complete the tasks she set out for fiscal year 2020 in the second half of the meeting. During the second half, Emily developed and capitalized on the unique strengths of her individual employees. When listing goals and tasks for the next year, she was sure to suggest which departments and which people have the best skill set to complete each task. Then, at the end, she allowed each member of the HR leadership team propose their own projects for the next year which any employee could sign up to be apart of. This definitely created a sense of collaboration and allowed employees to work with people they may not normally interact with. This also gave employees the opportunity to join a project that they were interested in even if they didn't have the best skill set and develop the skills needed to complete the project."
"I attended Lenders School and I got to work with loan officers. I had the opportunity to share my opinion, work in groups, conduct hypothetical situations and case studies. The people that I spoke to had common goals and they spoke to me about their career path. It was interesting to me because I learned we had a lot of the same values and career paths. Others seemed to like my input during the case studies and it helped everyone to reach a shared goal for a particular case study or situation we were studying. I was told that I did well keeping up with the rest of the class by answering questions and collaborating. "
"I attended the sustainability webinars that were presented during lunch hours. There were folks who were looking to get furthering education certificates there and some interesting discussion and proposals during this time. I was able to represent a younger demographic as well as one who has been studying sustainability in school. One idea I proposed was to plant trees for every business travel trip in an attempt to offset some of the carbon expenditure. Following this, I lead discussion on the ideas surrounding this proposal."
I attended weekly meetings to discuss our goals and how we could work towards them as a team. 
"I became well versed in making sure everyone was doing their tasks. To make sure everything was done every day, I had to step up and set a good example by rounding everyone up and getting them to do what was needed rather than slack off. This was hard at first, but after awhile it became easier to motivate others to do what was needed. "
I believe I have an intermediate proficiency in leadership. A story that reflects this is my ability to lead in my sorority. I recently was elected as the Vice President of Marketing which allows me to create a marketing team that will help me throughout the year. Through this position I will have to lead 4 girls. 
"I believe I used this semester to take more of a step back and listen more than lead in order to truly absorb the experience. However, There were times when I believe I could have represented a leader role such as work with the communication department newsletter, I would reach out and ask for feedback while giving feedback and taking the initiative to do so."
"I believe leadership relates to my Ramen advertising campaign example as well. This is because in order to ""sell"" my idea I had to communicate my vision to my mentor and other team members and get them on board with the project. This enabled me to empower others to achieve my vision by developing and implementing the project."
I believe that many times throughout my internship experience supervisors would recognize the strengths of different researchers. Often times my head supervisor Marcela would see problems Oliver and I would face with our research and she would point out people that had strengths in the areas we were struggling in so that we could reach out for help when needed. 
"I believe that my level of proficiency in Leadership is Intermediate. Our leaders encourage discussion and like us to be open and honest. At the end of the night, we have track talk where we talk about what works and what doesn't. This way we are communicating our thoughts and ideas to everyone. "
"I believe this happens a lot with me and my boss, we ask each other's opinions, advice or views on different tasks. She will ask me about how to approach an issue with a colleague and I ask her advice on how to approach different tasks I'm given. We have a constant, respected flow of communication that helps us build and contribute to our common goals. "
I came across a senior manager allocating the project to different people based on the strength in their areas.
I can give clear instructions to other that tell you how to complete a specific task.
"I chose intermediate because I take the lead on group projects at times. Within these projects, I try to ensure that everyone can have a say in what we are doing."
I chose the basic proficiency level for leadership. I have two managers who are both very knowledgable and skilled for there purpose in the lab. I have seen one of my managers many times gather a group of us to complete tasks. My manager understood each one of our weaknesses and strengths. He then used our varying skills to help make the work place most efficient. 
I co-led the social media ambassador program where we had to facilitate a healthy discussion with the ambassadors about what we expected from them and what they wanted to learn from us. So that we could have healthy two-way communication.
I collaborated with other interns and their project for the purposes of storm-water management.
I communicated accomplishments of the Spiro institute to Spiro Institute board members. I was able to discuss several objectives we met throughout the year and different activities we do on a day to day basis.
I communicated my ideas clearly to my colleagues from another division who were impressed to let me work on a project individually with minimal support from them. 
"I conducted a brain storming session with my team members to explore the possible solutions to the problem. The session was very helpful as provided an opportunity for every team member to express his own ideas and also ensured that we considered multiple approaches to solve a problem. Ultimately, it led to optimum and effective problem solving "
I converse with many colleagues about an issue and we collaborate on an equal level to develop a solution.
"I co-planned Tigers Unite, another new student-athlete development program within Athletics. Tigers Unite's goal is to form a community with other student-athletes in hopes to create Tolerance, Inclusion, Growth, Equity, Respect, and Service within the Athletic Department. Tigers Unite is a place to create relationships with other multicultural organizations including Athlete Ally, International Student-Athlete Association, and the Minority Student-Athlete Association. By connecting different multicultural organizations, all the organizations benefit. It gives each organization more support, and creates broader organizational objectives outside of each individual organization. Ideally, Tigers Unite also influences and supports global objectives of making Clemson Athletics, Clemson University, and beyond, better."
"I created a kickstarter video for my company, kanga, which we were able to create and fully direct to tell a story. It took over a month of setting schedules and editing it appropriately. "
I created surveys for students to fill out to see how good of a job the staff is doing while working with other departments to formulate them.
I created the Career Fair worker schedule. I worked around each person's schedule and tried to place them at their desired role. Creating and communicating this schedule helped the fair run smoothly and ensured that we had enough help at each station. 
"I currently serve as the president of my sorority, Kappa Alpha Theta, in this role I am the main point of contact for the other 23 officer roles. My daily goal is to make sure my organization is running smoothly and towards the widest influence for good. In order to make sure this is done successfully, I have to help all of our committees communicate with one another to make sure we are doing all we need to be doing, while helping others."
"I dealt with self-leadership a lot, I work alone and was in charge of my own work and turning it in on time."
"I define leadership as an influence on the others around you. How I showed leadership this semester was always encouraging if someone doesn't know something, ask, so we can find that solution. If I don't know that solution, the internet is a great tool. This promote collaboration and technology skills."
I demonstrated leadership by always showing up to work and displaying respectful communication.
I developed a spreadsheet which helped us to keep a track of the cost budget sheet. That sheet was aacesible to all the employees on the job site and helped all the employees to spend accordingly.
"I developed discussion questions for the ""Proud to Be a Woman"" dinner event. Following the panel discussion, each table used these questions to guide their conversations about the complexities of identity, discrimination, and value."
"I did not do very much leadership, I was mostly working on creating software alone. I appreciated the various meetings I had with Dr. Riggs and the researcher to report my progress and show my work. The leadership of the researcher helped me make design choices when making the app."
I did not encounter a situation like the one listed above.
"I did not get a lot of leadership opportunities this semester, but I did get to witness my mentor run weekly meetings. He had a definite leadership role in these meetings."
I did not have any leadership roles here
I did not have to deal with any stakeholders in this project
"I did this very often with my co-intern, Alex. Each week we would set goals that we wanted to achieve, and proceed to go over them with Kelly in our weekly meetings. I would take initiative in communicating to Alex and Kelly what I needed from them in order to achieve a given goal. "
I didn't necessarily gain leadership from this internship but I got to see supervisors use it to keep the office running well.
"I didn't really have any specific opportunity for leadership. However, I did take lead in some of the meetings with the suppliers as a representative of ZF, which I believe was crucial."
"I didn't see this, I am the only intern"
"I don't have a specific situation-answer to this question, but my general policy when running events is to have everyone involved around to come up with ideas when we're trying to figure out how to set up an event. This involves many voices: myself, other employees, clients, and I, as the building tech am the one who leads the conversation toward what we can do and how we can bring ideas to reality. I do my best to incorporate as many of those voices as I can in the most effective capacity we can come up with."
"I don't think my internship offered a lot of leadership opportunities because the whole point is to learn not lead! Crystal was leading me to become a better writer, and that is exactly what I was looking for. "
I employed my leadership skills leading meetings. 
I empower my desk associates to get as much work done as possible every day.
I empowered the coaches to want to change the lives of the middle school girls through our lesson plans. 
I encourage discussion daily when I ask my coworkers about any improvements they would like to see in our department
I encourage discussion within my group and within the CEDC board of directors when asking for feedback or sharing ideas for a solution.
I encouraged a discussion about how to solve an issue with a design.
I encouraged a helpful discussion on a video script on the history of the Tiger Paw.
I encouraged discussion between all the employees by always listens to my peers and taking into consideration that someone could have a better and easier way to do things. An example is someone suggested putting more feed into the feed bins so we would not have to feed up the turkeys so many times a week. 
I encouraged discussion between interns and directors regarding a trip to see manta rays. The interns felt very differently from the directors and I helped them to reach a solid middle ground.
"I encouraged discussion during the rebranding idea generation because while my ideas are strong, the opinions of others matter and it is always good to get different points of view. This went towards our shared goal of rebranding the Watt. "
I encouraged discussion over the rubrics I made to figure out what could be done differently or changed and what was done well.
I encouraged discussion with my mentees while having a group meeting. Each student do not learn everything at the same speed. I allowed them to share different study tips they had and other ideas that they thought would benefit the group.
I encouraged my co-worker to provide feedback if he had a different point of view than mine when working together on a project.
I encouraged my fellow internship to apply for 4-H extension agent positions post graduation and helped her prepare
I encouraged my peers and business majors to give me feedback on how the website looked and what their general impression of the program was. 
I encouraged the SFG coaches to be the best leaders they could be for the girls and to inspire them. 
I engaged anthropology club members to become involved in the new Business Anthropology course through a brief presentation and the distribution of fliers. I stressed the necessity of anthropology majors to gain business skills and how the course could benefit them. I also communicated accomplishments through agendas that were distributed to committee members.
I engaged the anthropology club to communicate the goals of the business anthropology program and was able to engage them to promote the program. 
I enjoy the responsibility of leadership and am constantly growing to improve upon it.
"I entered this internship with minimal computer science and data visualization experience. As such, I actively learned as much as possible from the people around me. I noticed another intern, Tom Birdsong, taking responsibility and leadership over the creation and initiation of the CCIT Immersive Space. In our group meetings, he encouraged the other interns to take on various projects and worked to both better the space and have students regularly use it."
"I facilitated discussion about the types of cards we should use for Week of Gratitude. There were many different opinions and different options to go with. In the end, we chose the most successful card."
I feel like I have grown a lot since my first co op rotation. I am able to lead meeting and projects with more ease.
"I feel like leadership is displayed in different ways. One way is listening and then responding. I feel like i've done both during this position. I would listen to a client, or co-worker, and then would reply with what I believe would be the next step/solution and give my resasoning."
"I feel like this is a tough question for my internship as a writer. I would say the whole goal of my writing is to take an individual's story, line it up with the goals of Clemson's philanthropic visions, and then publish it for all to see. "
"I feel that I fell quite short of my potential as a leader this semester. I often found myself so caught up in my work that I failed to hold or attend the meetings I should have. Nonetheless, I did display SOME advanced leadership skills that I learned from studying. This skill was ""listening before speaking."" Rather than holding a meeting about a problem or idea and simply presenting my ideas and then asking for feedback, I would present the problem/ idea and ask for feedback BEFORE giving my input. This put me in a position to hear the unbiased thoughts of the rest of the team, thus giving me better data and making them feel more valued."
I feel that my leadership level has grown since I have worked here
I film and post student feature videos weekly. Students are nominated by staff. Sometimes the students I meet are camera shy but I also do my best to make them feel comfortable and confident. I often find that the students who share they are nervous behind the camera are the students whose stories shine.
I found a reliable mentor during my internship who supported and gave me valuable feedback on my work. I worked with her to test few design schemes for the Lowcountry Lowline before reporting to my supervisor.
"I found myself taking a great deal of leadership in steering the progress of the program, by far the biggest project of my internship this semester. I had to not only hold myself accountable, but hold my mentor, the presenters, and all contributors accountable to ensure that everything for the program was turned in on time and reflected our absolute best work. Similarly, during the actual conference, I had to take on a position of leadership to ensure that everything flowed smoothly and was pleasant for the attendees so they could learn and grow from the conference. I often found myself in a position where I was ensuring that everyone was informed of what they needed to be doing, which then allowed the conference to flow smoothly. "
I frequently received new technology tutorials from people within the department to learn how to use new programs. 
I gave solutions to solve the problems of the line and robots.
I generally worked alone
"I got to a point where I felt that I could ask to head up an idea, mainly the idea to write for the Clemson Newsstand. "
I got to see my mentor lead groups at multiple events. There was always communication and other elements involved in the activities. 
I got to see the social media marketing team be lead by Robbie on what they need to be doing each week and he was very encouraging and helpful in planning out what videos/pictures they needed to capture and when to post them. 
I got to sit in on a budget meeting where my supervisor and someone else worked together to change the budget to better fit the needs of that sport.
I got to visit quarterly meetings for University Relations. Seeing how the leaders within this department lead and run the show was very interesting and many lessons were learned from it. 
I greatly encouraged Carrie Russell to use her background in Psychology to help us push IRB reviews as no one else in the lab had the experience she had. I used this as an opportunity to push everyone to share their ideas and aspirations in order to create a very compelling argument to our professor.
"I grew to be an expert in leadership this semester through continuous examination of my all of my mentors, including Tim Howard, Dr. Todd, and even Owen Phillips. As Chief of Staff, I was tasked with leading the team safely through the semester and help them help others. I was in charge of training them in the beginning of the semester before school started and throughout the semester giving them advice not only related to internships but life as well."
"I had a problem mid-way through the semester with my higher up's not being responsible and allowing the lower ranking workers to get away with things that should not have been allowed. I had to call a meeting with everyone who was in that position to completely go over everything that they were supposed to have already been doing, and then added new steps to increase accountability in that position. I had to spend a lot of time checking back over their work to make sure that everything was on track, but so far the work has been exceptional! "
I had a task to write a script for data analysis. I proposed a solution for that algorithm and everyone was impressed with the idea. I was told that no intern had ever proposed such an effective solution like me. Now my program is being used by other groups as well.
"I had coworkers that were grad students that I often had to motivate. It can be difficult to stay on track sometimes because of the large task a research project an have. But, I worked with them and helped motivate them."
"I had good communication with the supervisor that I had to report to. Since I was the first intern to join for that particular project, I helped the interns who joined later on to learn about the production process and the work that was expected from us."
"I HAD PROJECTS THAT HAD TO BE IMPLEMENTED OVER THE ENTIRE WAREHOUSE. SO IT WAS NOT ALWAYS POSSIBLE TO TAKE THE LEAD AND DO EVERYTHING ON MY OWN. BUT WHEREVER POSSIBLE, I INTERACTED WITH PEOPLE AND TAUGHT THEM THE WORK INSTRUCTIONS AND GOT THE WORK DONE"
I had taken the initiative of guiding the two interns who came in a month after I began. I helped them with both technical and non technical aspects.
"I had the opportunity to go to a CoCreate event: Photography Bootcamp. I spent the entire day with a large group of about 30-40 people. The main speaker was able to keep everyone engaged, answer questions thoroughly, provide great examples, and teach us a lot about photography. He knew people in the crowd, so he was able to use individuals in examples and talk about certain styles of photography for different occasions. He took us on a ""photo walk"" so that everyone would have a chance to try out what we had learned from his presentation and to see how he takes different types of pictures in and outdoors. Overall, he was a great instructor and leader."
"I had the opportunity to sit in on two different Board meetings; the first at the beginning of my internship and the second towards the end of my internship. In the beginning, I was able to explain to the key stakeholders in the organization the value that I was going to bring to the organization but also the vision I had for the few months I was there. I loved being able to go back and report the success I had with the Facebook page to the Board at the second meeting. They were able to buy into the need for the Facebook and Twitter through my beginning actions and allowed me to get participation from them for future posts. "
"I had the pleasure of leading our student mentors. It was my job to make sure that they had all of the information/supplies they needed in order to effectively do their jobs. Additionally, it was my duty to make sure they all knew exactly what other roles they needed to perform as program leaders."
"I had the project of leading a development of a scholars program for first generation students. This project had multiple parts and communication was needed between the other interns in the department, along with Sherry and our graduate student. This project is nearly complete, although the implementation of it may be postponed."
I had to add in the newsletter how my supervisor won staff employee of the year. I can tell she deserved that award because all of the students had a great relationship with her. Seeing her give advise allowed me to see how good of a leader she is. 
I had to be a very inspiring leader this semester to drive my mentees to better.
I had to create storyboards for videos and Instagram stories for the videographer. I had to explain these storyboards and get her to understand them and be excited about them as well.
"I had to drive the change to the new database, so I had the responsibility of taking leadership on this and making sure it was going in the correct direction. In our weekly staff meetings I would drive other team members to use the tool, and use it effectively. "
I had to encourage others when completing big task like cleaning all of the pens in a big house
I had to explain and convince the company to change their strategies about how to approach the market
I had to get photos from mentors in order to create a more updated website.
"I had to give a seminar presentation on the research my CI team and I did, and I was able to share lots of results from analyzing the data we were looking at and also share specific findings from certain group members. "
I had to lead our monthly meetings and be the person to respond to emails with questions from students about the ME shop.
I had to make exeuctive decision. 
I had to open the semester with one of my project team with a discussion of the different strategies the team could do to revitalize and make more relevant a website they were put in charge of running. I tried to encourage others to add input to each other's ideas and also encourage discussion of how those ideas could be realized.
"I had to present the idea of PEER Talks to Mrs. Serita in order to be able to execute the event. We both want the best for PEER; therefore, I had to communicate my intentions and plan of execution. "
"I had to work with 3DS, my boss and my peers to create an event that inspired others to start their own company. I was in charge of a lot and had to take in different opinions and perspectives to make the best decisions. We had one goal, to have a successful event, and we had to align the objectives to reach it. "
"I had two mentors for this summer and each helped me work on my projects. Outside of helping the graduate student, I was working on a project in ecosystem services and another in microplastics. Both of my mentors relied on me to communicate and stay on top of my tasks between the two of them as well as transport the data and split my time between the lab and the field. "
I has to host a competition for about 50 shooters with my fellow intern with out our mentor. 
"I have a lot of previous experience as a leader, but Entity helped me learn to guide myself to accomplish set goals. When we presented to Modify, I was the group spokesperson who communicated with Modifly's CEO to share our ideas and recommendations for the company's Instagram."
I have a manager on the project and assured that the project deadlines were met.
"I have been a leader by starting my own articles without request. In order words, I found topics outside of my mentor's suiggestions and completed them based on my own initiative to succeed and bring news to Inside Clemson. Therefore, I was a conduit to assist multiple groups in having their voice be heard. "
"I have been a part of several Kaizen events, which JW aluminum calls Rapid Improvements Events. Its basically a week set aside to making numerous small changes to directly lead to workplace improvements. This entails a corporate/ management of 1-3 people (my role), and a larger group of 5-10 floor level teammates. The goal is typically to improve a specific area of the factory in one specific way. For example: improving the safety of our receiving building by painting proper traffic lines, setting up work flow, chaining off restricted areas and so forth. My supervisors and the management team have specific goals and outcomes they need to achieve. So it was often my task to guide floor teammates into seeing the reasoning for these changes. It also means hearing the needs and ideas of these floor teammates and in a sense molding these values and ideas in a way that will meet the upper management's desired outcomes."

"I have been working on a program that will allow freshman physicist to take tours of biophysics labs. There is a negative attitude toward biophysics among the undergraduates in the physics department, and this program would make sure the first impression freshmen have is positive, and accurately portrays what biophysics is. This program would also encourage freshmen to join biophysics labs if they like the research that is presented to them, and therefore allow them to get involved in research earlier in their college careers. I am currently gathering support from other biophysics labs, so we can showcase several research projects to freshmen. I hope to make our department more open to different types of research by keeping this program alive. "

"I observed a lot of advising sessions that the coordinators held for students going on different study abroad programs. I noticed that they gave their full attention to an individual student and listened intently as they described what they were looking for in a study abroad program. The coordinators then factored in personal preferences, cultural background, financial situation, etc to find the exact right program for a student. Sometimes these sessions would last up to an hour, but the coordinators were happy to sit there for as long as it took to make sure that the student walked out of there happy with their decision.

I went through every learning experience submitted for each month, and found events that were exemplary through upholding learning outcomes and assessing the event. From the best learning experiences, I would choose one to highlight on social media. I think this acknowledgment allowed other RAs to see that they all have shared vision, congratulated the recognized RA, and highlighted the hard work and leadership of our RAs to the community. "

"I saw this when I watched my mentor, Crystal Fulmer, identify strengths and talents in our team, including myself and our other interns, and assign specific work we could do together as a team, but things that fit our abilities the best. I saw how she was able to manage our Law Enforcement summit preparation along with Morgan Danyi our GA. "
I see how my advisors lead group members.
I see my mentor almost everyday lead families and students to a shared vision or goal. Many families visit my mentors office to discuss the pathway their child need to take to reach the goal of professional school. My mentor leads these students and families through the hard times that they encounter with school. She lets them know that everyone pathway is different so do not get discouraged. This ultimately helps the people reach their goal because it keeps them on track and determined. 
"I see people operating within their strengths all throughout the office. My supervisor does a lot of research and data analysis and once she has the information, she often passes the information along to someone else in the office. They typically have the job of taking her information and putting it in visual form."
"I selected the basic choice for this because I wanted to mention the weekly meetings with my adviser Dr. Wole where all viz interns came together to express ideas and progress through projects, and I observed some of his leadership skills bringing to people and ideas together to foster a new project, and how we as a team where then able to bring our individual ideas all together and capitalize on our collective resources. "
"I served as a conduit to assist groups in aligning objectives with broader goals of the Honors College in my role of leading the Honors ambassador committee. This is a group of student ambassadors who create novel ideas of how to make the prospective student experience as well as ambassador program more beneficial. This semester, I partnered with some of the committee members during the interview process for new ambassadors. In part of the interview, we were role playing what a prospective visit would be like with a student to evaluate how personable each applicant was. Initially, the role playing was not as professional as I wanted it to be so I was able to discuss what I imagined the role playing situation would be like with the committee member. Working with them, I was able to align our goals to the overall goal of the Honors College to have personable and knowledgeable ambassadors to help the prospective students! "
I served as a conduit when I combined the efforts of Healthy Campus and the Michelin Career Center to put on an outreach event for these 2 departments. I provided tip sheets to students on how to maintain holistic wellness and provided them with resources to help monitor their mental health and destress.
I served as a facilitator of a student-based panel during SEE Clemson. The idea was to separate the students from their parents so they can ask any personal or general questions about Clemson. I led two 45 min panel sessions and lead the discussion that included the pros/cons of Clemson and everyday tips to become a successful college student. 
"I served as a leader by helping to edit the intern book for next year. While I unfortunately will not get a chance to meet the intern, I like to think I helped them through this form of advice. "
I served as a liaison for the students of the Honors College and the Honors College staff. I had to work with various organizations within the Honors College and offer assistance and advice when they came to me to get information about how to promote their programs.
I showed leadership by helping the children in the 4-H program to achieve their goals. 
I sometimes had to direct videos and those in the video to recreate our ideas. 
"I spent most of the first half of this internship designing the weeder attachment. After I had gotten to a point that I felt I’ve done the most for the design, I took it to my mentor to see what his thoughts were. Having that feedback really allowed me to make the best weeder I could. It had to go through several different interactions before I began fabricating the design. The way I see it is I can only do and design so much. The way I think isn’t necessarily the “correct”. Taking in input from others isn’t so much about furthering my goals and aspirations, but rather the goals of the group. "
I spent some time during this internship training another intern on how to perform weekly radiation surveys in Clemson labs. This enabled her to become a part of the research safety team at Clemson and to perform a vital function.
I spoke during each orientation session to the incoming students explaining the difficulty of the course work and providing guidence to help them succeed. I acted as a leader to assist them in their transition and answer any question that they had pertaining to the major and career fields after they graduate. 
"I started clocking in for my shirt at least thirty minutes early at the beginning of the semester in order to make sure all of my responsibilities were completed in a timely manner. Soon after, my other coworkers began to clock in early as well when they saw how much smoother their daily duties went when they got them done earlier. "
I suggested a better way to implement a certain piece of code. The firm had been doing it another way up until now. They were very accommodating to the new way as they saw it's numerous benefits.
I supervised student activities 
"I supervisor is a true leader. During meetings, he always summarizes the content of the presenter every couple of minutes to make sure everyone is on the same page. "
I support everyone in our office and I try to empower others to strive to do their best. I have had so many opportunities to learn about the vision of the COB and how to continue the vision. 
I take on leadership roles in the office. 
I think I always my boss let me do what then I will do what. 
I think I see instances of Leadership from Mark all the time when he interacts with the technology providers and makes decisions on what to do with them. He's also always the person to go to for people in the building when something goes wrong.
"I think leadership and collaboration were tied closely together during my internship because the advisors work so closely together at the ASC. When trying to figure out what our student population needed, I asked the advisors for their opinions on workshop topics that the students would benefit from learning and what the most popular majors are. Everyone had diverse ideas and I had the privilege of combining them to make a well- rounded support program. "
"I think my time as EU's project lead was an effective one. I think one of my biggest assets is being able to convince a group of people to be interested in a topic, which I think is due to my positive attitude and passion for things I'm a part of. As such, with EU having more new interns than usual this semester, I made it a point to work with my team to bring about the point that we needed to work together to set a foundation for what the new EU would look like."
"I think one area that I have seen this through is how we respond to our negative comments on social media. When we respond, we must remember that we represent the entire department and speak for everyone when we respond to these things."
"I think our office is unique in that we are assigned specific jobs but each person usually ends up working on everything that goes through the office in one way or another. We are an incredibly collaborative group, often asking for design advice from other employees and even asking them to take over a job we aren't sure about. I often find that I spearhead jobs and then delegate to other people throughout the whole thing, making sure that each person's opinions are heard and everyone feels valued and useful."
"I think that I am a good leader, but there were definitely others in my internship that knew more about the field than me. I preferred having them lead and show me the ropes. I personally gained leadership experience from how they taught me."
I think that something that worked very well for myself and the other interns in my department was having bi-weekly meetings. We were able to encourage one another on goals that we all were reaching for. I was able to support and help encourage other interns in the similar field I was working in. 
I think this competency somewhat goes hand-in-hand with collaboration in that my hesitation to share my ideas prevents me from exceling in this area. I have gained more confidence in this internship because I felt as if I was really needed in the company and had a large role which increased my leadership competency to intermediate. I think an example of the time I saw this competency displayed the most clearly by me was when I volunteered to be the videographer for a shoot after work and I lead the front on creating the content for that client. 
I took a lot of initiative this semester by actively seeking project from my mentor in order to not only help the department for the future but to also allow myself to apply my skills and foster the same initiative in other employees so that anyone in our staff would feel confident
"I took initiative several times to contact multiple groups around campus and inquire about possible press release topics they may want to share. I did investigative research that I was then able to communicate with my supervisor. Often times, my initial information was used by collaborators to enhance a story."
"I took initiative to create new projects that I felt like would aid students. For example, the veteran's benefits video I created was to better assist students who are military veterans or dependent."
"I took it upon myself to create a few promo tools to help the Outdoor Lab gain more awareness. My boss didn't necessarily tell me they needed them, but I knew that he wanted to achieve a higher awareness for the business. In the end, we created some great material to move closer towards their vision. "

"I try to empower the other workers by letting them give their feedback on the magazine. I let them have a say in my work and I give opinions/critique on their work as well. I also showed leadership by running some meetings and asking others to work on specific projects. I also try to show leadership when someone backs out of something or can not do a project, I will step in and take over to make sure the project gets done. For example, we had an interview video to make and the photographer/videographer could not make it last minute. Instead of canceling I decided to still do the interview myself so it would still get done on time. "
I undertook many new projects this semester that were new and different from things I have worked on in the past. 
"I urged students to sign up for different parts of our Research Summit including poster sessions, 3 minute thesis, and a 15 minute presentation on their research. Once they signed up, I created an itinerary for my mentor and the program's steering committee. "
"I was a motivator for the team. Even when times looked rough, I told them that they are more than capable to complete tasks and projects."
I was a part of a Formula student team-Praheti Racing which made its maiden expedition to a Formula student competition in Italy. My team captain had very good leadership skills who believed in the concept of 'lead by example'.

He divided the teams into sub-teams based on the unique capabilities/strengths of various students and it proved to be effective.

"I was able to empower our lab group by making configuration setup changes to allow part of our lab to be painted. I became a leader by being able to suggest ideas to help us come up with a final decision that worked for everyone. I proposed paint colors and decoration choices and also assisted in the procurement of materials and the actual painting work itself. Overall, I have learned a great amount of leadership skills from this internship."

"I was able to see the HR do such a great job at recognizing the hard work that each staff member does. They hosted a nurse appreciation week, a janitorial appreciation week, a family fun day for families of the staff, and constantly praised people for hard work. I contributed to family fun day and received a thank you letter later that week from HR and that spoke volumes to me about how I should treat my co-workers one day. "
"I was able to sit in on multiple meetings during my internship this summer. Although I was a passive observer, I was able to gain valuable experience through observation. On multiple occasions I was able to witness my boss and his coworkers pitch perspective clients by each leveraging their unique skill set and knowledge. While each team member brought unique skills to the presentations, it was their ability to combine these skills in a cohesive, well run pitch that led to so much success. "
I was able to take charge of certain tasks that were given to me. So I was given the responsibility and leadership to complete them on my own. I wasn't really given take many leadership opportunities. But I think it was hard to do that in my type of setting.

I witnessed countless times full time employees leading these brainstorms really pull information from people, both interns and full time workers, by encouraging them to share. They were positive and receptive to any idea that was thrown out into the room because they really believed that one idea could lead to another great idea and so on."

"I was assigned to lead a project on my own, which required me to involve several other parties among several different departments - engineering, quality, and cubing. I needed to redesign a part, so all of them were necessary to help. Because I was leading the project, I was responsible for creating the communication stream among all of them on the same topic. As I tried to develop my own ideas, I encouraged others to voice their opinions and give constructive criticism on the process and how everyone could work together. In the end, everyone was able to collaborate well and succeed in the part's redesign."

"I would say my answer for the communication skills question also applies to this question. Also, LPH puts on a Avian Influenza simulation game for the students studying Agribusiness or Animal and Veterinary Science at Orangeburg Calhoun Tech. I was able to plan and coordinate this game, as well as work with my fellow employees to walk/lead them through the simulation."
I would take on projects that I was the leader of and had to make a plan to carry out.
I’ve been able to innovate by using different equations to figure out other ways to numerically evaluate particular risks that are vital to understanding the magnitude risks within each department. I’ve also used technology to create word clouds to become aware of the language being used within the data

"In a competition which was going on as a part of event in the company where I am working, I joined a team that I did not know some members of it. There was no enough time to get to know them so I had to regulate myself and get along with them to achieve the obvious goal which was winning. After a couple of failures, I had some idea about the approach of each team member to the problem we were trying to solve. So I started to have concise discussions with them in between to plan out for the rest of the competition. While having short conversations among the team players in the middle of the competition, I often gather all the team members to discuss each individual's opinions quickly. I tried to ask at least one player's opinion in each short talk out of the several discussions which we had during the game. Eventually and surprisingly we won the competition."
"In a leadership position for the Pearce Digital Marketing team, I helped brainstorm with and lead my peer Carter Smith to her writing subject for her blog post this semester. She was having trouble picking what to write about and I helped her reflect on the semester going over what might be valuable for her to write and the community to read.

Through patiently demonstrating the proper techniques, we were able to finish a beautiful and professional video."
"In conducting 3 Day Startup as my first event, part of the event was getting students to come together in groups to decide on a product or idea they wanted to work on over the course of the week. In doing this, there were inevitably different ideas among the group on the directions each team wanted to take on their product. I met with each team, listened to the different perspectives, and encouraged ways they could combine their idea together to take an even better direction."
"In coordination for the eight days of earth day I have had to reach out to a multitude of clubs as well as individuals and advertise to the campus. In everything I do I must make them aware of why this is important and why we should all unite and take the time in order to participate in this event. Each step will make a large difference in campus and contribute to our overall goal of assisting in Earth Day Awareness and Appreciation, and it is astonishing how many people do not hold a standard appreciation for the planet they live on. Leadership to alter this view in order to find support is necessary. "

"In many of the sites I use to do the samples for various construction materials, when I use to do the sampling and testing for grout I use to have a clipboard grout box. By the weight of the grout material that clipboard box use to warp and observe it and monitor the warping of group box daily gave an idea of strengthening the grout box so that I would not warp. This experience helped me to inform the project manager about the situation."
In meetings I would often lead discussions regarding how we are currently structured and operating to allow everyone to voice opinions on we could achieve our goals more efficiently. 
"In meetings our Lead designer and I would often have to work together, and we both had differing ideas of the thematic direction we wanted to take the magazine in, however when in meetings although he and I had different viewpoints on what would effectively communicate the idea, I would often take the lead on deciding who would defer to the others opinion and in what situations that was appropriate, basically If I felt that my partner could improve his design, I never outright said that, I wanted to maintain the respect he deserved as my technical superior, so I would offer alternative suggestions, and offer ideas about tools to use to enhance design, but I never undermined him, I take a lead from behind approach to leadership, I prefer to offer assistance, and encourage different ways of approaching a problem by making suggestions and directing a line of thought, rather than directing a line of action. "
in MMS I dirved the project show I had to show right direction to the team.
"In my campus recreation internship I sat in on a meeting on how campus recreation can market to the school their new area of Fike Recreation. They were scared the new area would only be attractive to men and no women would use it.

I thought more women would be inclined to use the new area if this was the case. "
"In my employee orientation sessions, I had to use slides and lessons with the intention of inspiring the new employees to perform their best work and remain with our department for a long time. "
"In my group of interns, there is a wide variety of majors. It varies from chemical engineering, to electrical engineering, to civil engineering, to others. When presenting ideas about how we could save the company money, I had to be careful how I explained my thought process, since we all come from different backgrounds of specialties in engineering. I had to be detailed enough for the chemical and electrical engineers to know what to do, and simple enough for the civil engineers to help with the big picture of the problem faced."
"In my internship, I came across information for a grant application from Johnson&Johnson about nursing technology and innovation. I introduced this to my mentor and my fellow interns.

"In my meetings with the social media student team, I regularly participated in and encouraged discussion where individuals expressed different points of view to develop a shared vision for Clemson's social media presence. I enjoyed working in that sort of atmosphere because I watched several different viewpoints come to the table, and then we would all discuss and combine them to create one unified viewpoint. This was a successful way of running Clemson's social media, as it ensured the media was created on several different levels and from several different stances, and made the whole department more well-rounded."
"In my project, I have three people including me in the team. Sometimes, we had different arguments and didn't agree with another person's argument. To overcome this, I usually listened to their arguments first. Then, I gave another opinion and told them why I didn't like their arguments and why they should agree with my argument. Of course, that's just my opinion. I didn't force them to agree with my argument. "
"In my role as the primary connection between the Watt Family Innovation Center and the Clemson Immersive Space, I worked to balance individual objectives of both groups while maintaining a focus on the common overall goal of improving student success through increased access to disruptive technologies. For example, the Watt Center emphasizes cleanliness throughout its building as a part of its brand, so I ensured that promotional materials within the Immersive Space fell within these guidelines (were either explicitly Watt-sanctioned or adhered to the spirit of the Watt brand). Meanwhile, the Immersive Space had the objective of promoting collaboration among student groups, so midway through the semester I successfully lobbied the Watt Center for permanent access to an additional large collaborative display in the space. Throughout discussions for Immersive Space planning and the Watt Center's vision for VR deployment, I consistently aimed to find common ground for the two groups that would promote collaboration and increase potential for all sides to help students in new ways."
"In my role I have served as the head strategist for the Clemson Immersive Space, so I set goals for branding, operations, and outreach. I have led a staff team of four students (including myself) in establishing consistent operating hours and procedures in the Immersive Space. I also interact with users and lead group interactions with VR technology in the space on a regular basis."
"In my time during my internship, I observed a conference meeting that my mentor was having. During this meeting, they were planning a recreational day at one of the local extension offices.

"In one attempt to connect Luck Box, LLC with sizable investors and shareholders I displayed advanced leadership qualities. Flying in to Las Vegas, NV to meet ""Big Fish"" prospects, I spent 3 days working with and aligning a vision with these potential investors. I was able to also align the marketing team at Luck Box to share the vision I had crafted with these investors. In the end, I was able to align the visions of a marketing team with big time shareholders towards a common goal for innovation in the senior medical sector."
"In one of my projects it was paramount to glean information from as many operators as I could, to determine what might work well, what might not, and what problems I should take into consideration when thinking about my projects because many of these operators have more experience than I do and different opinions and experience which allowed me to accumulate a broad perspective to decide what and how to implement recommendations from my project."
"In one of our larger group meetings, I watched Peyton(another social intern) lead a meeting by giving numerous of thoughts. I would then also give my opinion. This helped me become more confident. "
"In order to empower others, I allowed trainees to do protocols first alongside me, and then encouraged them to do the protocols themselves once they felt comfortable on their own. In doing so, the three of us had to work together to achieve experiment goals originally set by myself and Dr. Alper through the two years I have been in the lab. Part of this experience also included communicating to others via Poster presentations etc the status of the research and future directions of the lab. "
"In order to execute successful programs that appeal to new generations of youth, it is important to use new ideas. This includes groupthinking with other people and reaching a common goal based on shared ideas."
"In order to facilitate discussion in the online workshop, I created discussion questions that were required for participants and gave positive feedback to those that were not only answering the question but also adding content to the class discussion."

"In our meetings about the Nutrition and Food Safety project, we brainstormed on different ideas and use the different perspectives from our team to create the most effective learning modules. We also evaluated the different methods of evaluation and registration, including which forms of data would be most helpful to me when writing my thesis."
"In our office we have little discussions every morning that include several people in the office, and during the times that we were very busy planning and executing the various events I have mentioned, everyone would be a little discouraged and disheveled. This would be when I would encourage everyone to talk about and layout exactly what had to be done for each event for it to be successful, and from here we would find a common goal and common vision for these events and would get going again."
"In our UPIC site visit, it was important for me to tell the coordinator the many things we have accomplished as a research team. Talking about the WRAPPED data analysis, talking about the proposals we have written and the fellowship applications we have written. It was also important for me to say the importance of the work we have done, because we have touched raw data that can help engineering students in SC. And it is important for me to communicate that to people. "
In our weekly group meetings with Dr. Moysey's grad students each week s.o. would present his current research. Dr. Moysey always encouraged but also questioned them in order to improve their research.

In our weekly Monday meeting my teammates would come up with creative ideas and i always respected them and gave credit when they were due. If i could add and make a better suggestion I did so but never discredited their ideas.
"In our weekly update meetings David Vaughn, my UPIC mentor, shows leadership by taking the groups task of creating an online platform for the lab and expressing both his opinion on what is best and being open to receive ideas from all involved."
"In pruefcubing, I saw this almost everyday. It's been a really rare experience, I'd say, because over the course of my assignment, the initial Cubing Leader changed positions and a new Cubing Lead was brought in. So, I got to see very different leadership qualities. It was numerous times that a problem would be found, leaving a team of engineers huddle around the Cube, with the Cubing Leader leading the discussion. From making suggestions, answering questions, to stamping off on a final solution or containment, it was a great experience to watch the engineers discuss and collaborate. "
in purchasing meeting trying to decide if its worth getting rid of a supplier
"In some of the meetings I attend, I serve as the representative of the Faculty Senate Office. Especially in my time with the Finance Committee I had to make sure the goals of the committee matched that of the whole Faculty Senate."
"In Task Force meetings, I worked alongside my fellow Task Force members to solve difficult problems in a short amount of time. We had to be quick on our feet with innovative ideas given a limited budget. I sometimes helped steer discussions by providing a student perspective to the conversation, and I frequently encouraged outside input as well so that I wasn't the only voice in the room."
"In the absence of team lead, I had stepped forward to hold and lead the operations support meetings."
"In the Alper lab, my research as direct connections to several other projects that are going on in the lab; these serve to branch biology with physics. In particular, I work alongside a colleague named Subash who is working on creating an optical tweezer that can be used for experimentation. Eventually the proteins that I purify will be placed within this system. Since we come from such different backgrounds, often time our approach to the same issue can be very different. In these instances, it is critical that we discuss all of our options, decide which plan suits our goals best, and which is the best way to achieve this goal in a timely and satisfactory manner. Together, we can coordinate our efforts in order to ultimately achieve our research goal of using a physical construct to obtain biological information. "
"In the Aquaculture Lab, there were many discussions on what was happening throughout the summer project and reasons why we thought that was happening. It was great to hear other points of views as well as share my own to see what and why we have different ideas."
In the beginning of the semester we set smart goals and periodically throughout the semester we would check them. Now that finals are approaching I created an excel sheet so that they can see what they need to do in order to reach that goal or if the goal can even be met. 
"In the beginning stages of the Raspberry Pi project dealing with the room temperature the first step was to discuss the requirements needed in achieving the goal. In that preliminary discussion, I wanted to quickly create some path for every group member to start on as a means of having some direction so I offered to discuss what parts we would need to buy, how often we would need to work on the project, and everyone's availability. In addition to this, I offered to buy hardware for common use in order to test ideas that dealt with the progress of the project."
"In the biweekly meeting, everyone was encouraged to say good things or bad things during the work of the past few weeks."

The students demonstrated an understanding of the material during a lesson later in the day. "
in the different meetings when we discuss modifications and enhancements to the user interface and optimization model. 
"In the Immersive Space we have different classes come in, and one class is the vr systems cs class with their group projects, and I worked with a group who was stuck for a bit and undecided on the path they were going to take, and I helped work out the issues and provide them info on what other groups had done, and facilitated conversation and helped to push their ideas in a different, better direction than what they were heading, and this further communication and discussion allowed them to figure out their new objective and get their project completed."
In the Makerspace I have led many of our team meetings. I was able to divest some of these responsibilities this year and make sure that other members of the team could take over - helping us identify future leadership. 
"In the Makerspace, we are always working to balance the agendas of multiple teams and individuals. Since we have a limited number of equipment, students are often competing for the use of this equipment. I have worked with students to have them combine their prints onto a single job to allow for better use of the machines. I have worked to balance the needs of different students and groups. This has trained me to balance the needs of multiple different groups and people and maximize the efficiency of the space so that everyone benefits."
"In the office, all of the interns help out with tasks related to football weekends. We delegate those tasks each home football game weekend and try to complete them the Thursday before the game.

"In the office, the department would have people nominate their coworkers for various accomplisments throughout the past month as well as honor those who have had the most donor visits or asks. I saw how the office celebrates different types of successes, personal, employees helping others, and going the extra mile as well as successes in the office. "
"In the operating room, there are various nurses and sometimes multiple doctors working on different aspects of patient care. While this occurred in all of the surgeries that I was able to observe, the most notable was during a Cesarean Section. The two doctors (one being my supervisor) both worked to make the incision and safely remove the baby from the uterus while the CRNA monitored patient vital signs and administered medication. The scrub tech maintained a sterile environment, the circulating nurse provided additional assistance and kept records of the progress of the surgery and after delivery the baby nurse was taking care of the baby. Each team member had a defined goal based on their varying levels of training and each was working towards a common goal of maintaining a healthy mother and baby."
"In the process of developing the Farm Days plan, we met with the staff of the Bart Garrison Agricultural Museum of SC to develop the plans. During this, I worked to encourage everyone to share the ideas, especially those I had heard my coworkers mention prior and I thought would be great ideas to implement for the event. Though I was not strictly in charge of the meeting, I knew the successful sharing of all the available ideas would be greatly beneficial to a success event and made sure to lead the discussion towards this beneficial sharing. "
"In the Programs Management Team division of Clemson Abroad, I work closely with 2 full-time employees. Often we have collaborative conversations about our work in the office. We discuss about the goals for study abroad programs we direct, the presentations we give to students, and the way we communicate our messages. My co-workers are great in allowing me space to speak openly about my thoughts and plans. As well, I do my best to ask for feedback or follow up so that I can ensure my best performance and encourage constructive comments. "
"In the regular (often) meetings that we had to have for crossing traffic detection, because of the complexities of the work, members of the team used to express different opinions for each part of the work. But we had to reach an agreement on using one of the approaches (opinions) for each section. So, I used to try to make detailed discussions between all the members of the team, explaining their methodology and hearing others', to come up with one and consistent idea as the best of all the ideas."
"In the yearly water consortium held in Clemson this year, stakeholders form a multitude of government organizations came together to discuss ways to improve water quality across the upstate of South Carolina. I helped lead this program and facilitated the combination and change of information. "
"In this internship, I communicated representative results to provide guidance for a large-scale project and demonstrated to that computational modeling methods have advantages for other large-scale projects across the site to management."
"In this internship, there were many nights spent working third shift. Occasionally, the other interns would become tired and not want to perform the work they should have been. I would take that opportunity to remind them of the importance of our work, and it helped us be successful in reaching our goals. We then presented our work to the project lead through a PowerPoint, and he was impressed with our teamwork and accomplishments."
"In training the new ambassadors, I worked with Megan to teach them the goals of the Honors College. I helped empower them to achieve the mission of communicating the mission and values of the Honors College with prospective students through visits and etiquette. "
In training this semester I had to speak infront of my peers and tell them the importance of what we do here in Aspire. 
"In trying to build our social media brand, there are naturally disagreements on the direction in which things should go, so I would serve as a mediator in those discussions while also giving my own opinion."
"Inspired by some of the tools that we found at AMECO, we acquired a large 50 mm combination wrench that we determined would be a neat way to award the project group that we deemed to be the hardest working group among all of the groups in CEDC. Concrete Testing, the project group that reported to me, was an extremely productive and effective group and were lead by a great project manager. We decided to begin “The Wrench” award this semester and by awarding this group “The Wrench” at the end of the semester, we saw that recognizing and awarding hard work and leadership would inspire other groups to do the same."
"Instead of assigning me and the other 2 interns with projects to do, Chloe laid out 3 main projects that she needed done in the beginning of the semester and allowed us to chose the ones that fit best with our strengths. "
Interacted with workers during the internship and learned from their experience about the challenges and their recommendations on process improvements

Interviewing candidates that will take over my job after I graduate.
"Involved in layout changed where managers made the decision based on our data, but we shared our ideas which were taken into consideration"
"It happened a few times during my internship that my supervisor recognized the unique strengths of members of the team on the subject of discussion. For instance, if my supervisor was suggesting to run a specific analysis, he would mention that person x is an expert and would ask for his/her point of view on how to do the analysis even if he had already had a suggested approach. "
"It is a running joke that the definition of Brooklyn is do things so good that they can't ignore you. That is one of my life mottos, I bring that type of attitude to work and will go the extra mile to get things accomplished. My co-workers respect me and in turn their work ethic and productivity increases when I am around. "
It is necessary for my fellow teammates to discuss the major observations they have made during the data collection and figure out the top 3 important cases of the week and highlight it during the managers meeting. It has provided me a good chance to encourage the teammates to express their points of view.
It is pivotal to get feedback from others so that I can design to meet everyone's needs not just one. 
"It was a common occurrence that myself or one of my coworkers would run into a challenge in Revit, our drafting and modeling software (technically BIM software, or building information model). We would typically discuss a solution based off of everyone's own experiences, because in most cases somebody else has already come across the problem at hand. Once, I was trying to figure out a certain way to model something, so I asked a few coworkers around me for their opinions and we were able to discuss and share our opinions for approaching the challenge. In the end, we had the same goal, but there are often multiple ways to reach that goal. I feel that I was able to keep our discussion productive and on track for our goal of solving the difficulty. And we did!"
"It was a common role in the Makerspace to get students working on a project together on the laser cutter. It was often my role to help them understand how the laser cutter works in a design aspect and how to get the best results. However sometimes the decisions were just design based and there was no right or wrong, just what the group preferred. i was happy to be a part of these conversations and encourage them to talk it out and see what they liked better!"
"It was always amazing to me to watch the care staff do their jobs on a daily basis with the same energy, enthusiasm, and compassion, all while providing quality care and assistance to the residents. The care staff did such a good job of knowing each residents and their needs and likes and dislikes and their individual backgrounds to cater their care so that each patient still felt like an individual and their wishes were always respected. "
It was during the audit when the Director of Quality had taken responsibility of the project and all departments were working under him. The DoQ knew each individual in the team if not he tried getting him know them. He dwelled on the every individual and used to motivate them to finish off work and within time handling everything and available for the team.
"It was great to see how the two ladies directly located in my office communicated, collaborated, and delegated tasks. I was also able to see interactions between them and their supervisors as well. I saw great examples of how delegating and allowing each member to take on accounts and clients and take ownership of various projects all works in conjuction with the others."
"It was my personal goal this internship to promote mental health awareness. I did this by having my menses tell me what they did every week for self care/ for themselves. I also opened up to my WISE staff about having and eating disorder and how important it is to look out for that within the menses because it is so common among college age girls, especially engineers who are under loads of stress."
It was one day when all of the interns were in the office for their scheduled work hours and one student was trying to get different perspectives on an idea that they had. They took all of our options into account to create a final opinion.

I've had to basically lead an assessment when my boss was not there.
"I've held multiple leadership positions throughout my time at Clemson. I led our team of interns in the school book project and organized the whole thing. I was able to lead my fellow interns in how to interact with the students and led the students to realize their potential with their writing and reading. However, we all came together with a shared vision of getting the students more interested in reading, and the goal of having the students continue reading and writing when they're home over summer vacation. "
I've observed Mark and his vision for how the building is to be run when we were learning the way the systems interact with each other. 
"I've seen how my mentor and his boss, Dustin, facilitate discussion in meetings with others in CCIT. They make sure everyone's voice is heard and they make sure we stay on track to achieving the desired goal. "
I've spent the semester watching my mentor learn about our new employees and how they each work best and learn. Seeing her adapt to their qualities was a good learning experience for me.
I've taken the lead on reformatting how to do an LCA.
"Jackie had all of her interns meet with her as a group at least once a week. In these meetings, Jackie would praise us for what we did well and give us ways we could improve. On top of that, she asked our opinions about different issues to come to conclusions about Inside Clemson. We were given the chance to put our two cents into discussions rather than just being told what to do. By working together, we could come to better conclusions than just having Jackie tell us what she thought about those issues. She really valued our opinions in those meetings and it was incredibly empowering."
"Jordy, who is the newest member of the compliance team, showed her worth by putting in more work and vouching for herself than anyone else in the office. "
"Just as mentioned above I have worked at my hometown since the summer prior to my sophomore year of high school. I am now headboard, manager on duty, head trainer, swim coach, and swim lesson instructor. I have to work well with my co-workers, show them respect and delegate efficiently. Especially as during high school, many do not want to put in the extra effort to efficiently do their job, I must make sure that I lead properly in order to maintain the work environment and get work don't well without creating a hostile environment. I have initiated a lot of events as well as changes regarding staffing and training. "
"Just now, we had to make sure that we cleaned out an entire house of pens (which normally takes us about 2 weeks) in a matter of days for a project that was doing a turn around study. I was able to talk with out staff and each come up wither our own solutions and then morph those solutions into the best possible game plan to do the project as efficiently and as quickly as possible."
"Just the other day, I was helping with a volunteer opportunity that was brought to my attention through work and got to meet some partners and individuals iMAGINE has a great working relationship with. I was able to see how they brought the group together and would ask questions to others that were thoughtful and got the others engaged by answering and thinking about answers. "
"knew how to carry out tasks when it was expected of me, and was able to lead others throughout the tasks if they did not understand"
Krysten worked tirelessly to put on the first coffee house and shuttled all around Clemson and Anderson to get catering and make sure everything was right. This showed dedication and helped us achieve our first successful event.
Kyle showed immense leadership when starting the development of our innovated evaluation system when we all got together to meet on the next steps to make it actually happen
"Last month we had about two team meetings a week with all the employees. My supervisor got everyone together and would show us this program on his computer that had our to do list. Together everyone would share what they have been working on and we would decide if the tasks were completed, in progress, or put on backlog. We would also develop more tasks depending on what their recent events were. "
"Last semester, Chloe had us interns do specific tasks and it was very structured (which I loved and was very comfortable with). This semester Chloe let us do more of our own things. She allowed us to use our strengths and capitalize them to make a great project, but also lettign us work on somethings that we may have wanted to improve, if we chose to do so. "
"Last semester, I acted as treasurer of the Makerspace. This semester, I moved into the VP/Chief of Staff position. We had a new intern take over the treasurer position and at first he was quite overwhelmed with all the responsibilities and decisions that needed to be made. I helped him get up to speed with our finances and procedures and slowly became more and more hands off. By the end of the semester, he is making many of the decisions on his own and using our advisers as a resource to help him achieve his goals and make sure that his plans align with the larger organizational goals."
"Last semester, I attended the CECAS Donors Event on behalf of the PEER/WISE Department. Many of the people in attendance were donors to the PEER/WISE Department and I was able to share the positive impact the department has had on me during my time at Clemson and how much I enjoy being able to impact others in a similar manner. "
"Last week, I attended one of Clemson Abroad's Pre-Departure Orientation sessions, in which our office prepares upcoming study abroad students with relevant safety information before they leave the country. By observing my boss Meredith Wilson lead this session, I was able to learn much about useful public speaking skills and ways in which to unite a group of people who do not know one another in a common goal of being safe while abroad."
Lead a project in which I had to collaborate with people from different departments and had to report the progress to senior engineers on a bi-weekly basis

"Leadership can be a tricky thing. Leaders need to be different things in different places. In Haiti, being a leader means you understand that your team is already uncomfortable/adapting to a new environment and you need to be there for them while also adjusting yourself also"
Leadership has always been a struggle for me. Therefore I tried to take on more of a leadership role in this organization. Knowing the tour guides gives us a way to organize our sales and style to match theirs. We know who has the ability to do and handle certain tasks and work around that. 
"Leadership is a big part of my role as intern. For example, I lead an information session on group fitness classes for the orientation ambassadors. I lead over 40 ambassadors through a workout and had them work together as a team to finish it. "
"Leadership is not just taking responsibility for large projects, it is being a leader everyday. I feel that I exemplified this by taking charge everyday of the work assigned to me and then going above and beyond to complete that work. "
"Leadership is sometimes a hard role to perform when working as an intern. Regardless of the challenges, it is important to show that you are able to perform your tasks without being watched over constantly. During my internship, I had to take partial leadership of overseeing the TigerSTEPS program. I had to make decisions on how the program would be ran, along with decisions on specific cases. If there were thing that I thought could be improved upon it was up to me to bring that up to the others who also were working on TigerSTEPS with me. As an intern, I had to act as a leader and make my own decisions, while also checking in with a supervisor. This is a unique opportunity because if I was unsure of something I had people to go to for help. While leadership isn’t my best competency, it has improved, but there is still plenty of room for growth. "
"Leadership is the area I think I gained the most this semester. I was often training other interns in the production room to create different types of jobs. I was able to teach other interns different things the computers could do, the best techniques for sign mounting, canvas building, printing, and laminating. "
"Leadership styles are the focus of our research, improving my understanding of this competency. "
Leadership taken by mentor during scrap issues helped me gain knowledge.
Leadership was a very essential part of the internship since i was solely responsible for many projects and hence improved my leadership skills .
Leadership wasn't needed. I worked mainly by myself
Leading alignment meetings for the Swimlane Diagrams caused the participants to communicate and understand eachother's goals and objectives.
Leading small groups during academic recovery meetings meant that I had to facilitate discussion with students. These discussions circulated around achieving their academic goals and how they would go about doing so. Many students had a range of responses based on their individual circumstances. 
Leading the development for the ccpd app.
Learned leadership qualities from my Site supervisor in first two weeks of Internship. I tried to implement these ideas in other meetings. I would put some ideas and asked others opinions. Would Appreciate any comments including criticism.
Led projects and assignments for completion
Led the project of integrating PPCR into Windchill
Led the team in the absence of my mentor in important issues related to issues central to our team.
"Like before in the Collaboration section I was a leader on the Eureka! trip and after each activity I would ask the students what was challenging about the task, how did they feel while trying to achieve the goal, what do they think they could do better next time, and then I would have them try the task again after discussing these questions. "
Like I said before when I was running the parlor it was my job to be the leader from setup to take down I was in charge so I had to be able to communicate and demonstrate leadership qualities and be the person others looked up to for advice and experience. 
"Like I said before, I have led multiple project while interning in the IT Department. This has allowed me use leadership skills to foster collaboration and achieve the results we need to accomplish our task. "
"Like I said earlier, I had to work with other process engineers and develop experiments that are good for the future of the company and the advancement of scientific knowledge. "
"Mallory and I helped out with the BeeCause event in Clemson that encourages local teachers in Pickens, Oconee and Anderson to implement bee hives into their schools. We organized a ""bee tote"" that the teachers took with them after the class. This tote had supplies such as life cycle figurines, pamphlets, teaching materials on pollinators and other useful resources they could use in the classroom. It was awesome to see these teachers come together and share the vision of the BeeCause event in their schools."
"Many mentors had different approaches to initially reaching out to their mentees. At one point, I was curious to whether a particular approach had been successful, and during a team meeting I asked the group about it and what their experiences with it had been in order to determine if I should attempt this method as well."
"Many of the conversations I had with the professors and students in the Creative Inquiry program that I was interviewing for each Decipher article, I had to discuss some interesting topics like why these students and that professor decided to get into the research they did. I was given the opportunity to hear about personal stories that helped inspire these people. I was also able to see and understand why research itself can be tricky and controversial in some instances, for example, one professor I interviewed discussed how her research method was not supported by other researchers because they didn't think it was an appropriate way to go about gathering information specific to her project. However, she told me that although you might have critics, it's important to express your opinion and engage in express different points of view."
"Many of the other student workers would ask me what there was today, and we would all work together to accomplish goals. Each employee has a special talent when it came to jobs that would utilize their potential we were sure to put them on that job. "
"Many of the people of the lab have specialized skills, be it Unity, design, or circuit design. To finish projects as efficiently as possible, projects are divided among the team based on their strengths. The original concept art will be done by one person, and then built and finalized by a pair of others. "
"Many of those same projects I took the leadership role in because I am bilingual and also I just always seem to drift towards it anyway. I led the team of interns to 3 separate, successful projects that helped the company immensely. "
"Many opportunities arose during my internship where a decision needed to be made in the lab or in the field. When the need to make a decision came about, I would seek the input of my teammates so that we could reach a conclusion."
Many time when I had a post idea I would go and ask for diffrent perspective on the idea to help me develop the full post. 
"Many times my site leader will gather myself along with the other interns and discuss plans for projects that we are working on, such as the Be Brilliant series, helping with convocation, coaching and other jobs in order for us to see the end goal, and ultimately working as a team to do so."
"Many times we have large lists of things to do before a seminar or trial. This can be overwhelming when there are only 2 or 3 people working at a time, but consistently we all gather together and discuss who is best at what and work to people's strengths, while trying to teach the others these tasks so they can accomplish them later on. We, in a sense, divide and conquer the huge list of tasks that need to be done and all continue to learn new things along the way. "
Marketed the 4+1 Graduate Program in order to inform other students about the program and urged them to take that step. 
"Matt Menard is the manager of the sales department at the Dynamo and Dash. One of the things I loved was that he always had ideas to spice things up in the office. He would often build games the sales department would take part in. We played “Mario kart” were each person started out with 3 balloons. When you made a sale over x amount, you got the chance to pop someone else’s balloon. Once all three of your balloons were popped, you were out. It was great, because people loved sneaking up behind others and popping balloons, but it also helped us sell a lot more tickets. "
"Me and a coworker were working together on a project, and we both had to be on the same page and achieve this shared vision by working together and making clear of what we both thought would work best for the job."
Me and Matt would often debate what we thought was the best way to finish plots the fastest or do the most amount in a day. 
Met deadlines 
"Michael and Melanie created content for the college on a regular basis, telling the stories of staff members and students. Being able to tell the stories of individuals who share different beliefs, values, and goals is important for showcasing what each individual offers to Clemson. They are strong communicators and leaders."
"Michael is the mentor for two UPIC interns, I do the graphics and Alyx does videography for the office. At the beginning of the semester he did a good job of introducing us and helping us get to know each other better. He is really good about recognizing our strengths and knowing what projects to give us. "
Milking 
"Ministry leader Tammie Southerland knew how to pull out the talents in her staff and interns. Tammie recognized the musical and teaching gifitngs of our administrator and gently called upon her to use them, pulling her just outside her comfort zone for the growth of the person and the ministry. It was really neat to see."
Monthly there was a one on one lunch with the mentor of the company to access my work and also the company's work with the internship. I provided valuable inputs to assist them in making changes for making the work of interns more efficient.
"Most of the time, I challenge employees to not sit still and to stay active. Sometimes, I would ""break"" things on purpose just to see if the team could solve the issues. Other times, I would lead by example, always looking for things to do and never being complacent."
Most of the work is done in the testing area and are done individually. 
motivated technicians to help push to get a project completed.
"Mrs. Lisa constantly recognizes and capitalizes on the unique strengths of Patrick, an Engineering who works in the PEER/WISE study hall."
"Much like with collaboration, I feel that I had to exhibit advanced leadership while tabling at Orientation as well. Again, many employees had never tabled for an Orientation event and I had to empower them to achieve success in answering new student questions. "
"Multiple new employees starting working in the Study Abroad Office this semester and my mentor, Mandy Prorok, did a great job respecting their strengths as they began working together throughout the semester."
"My actual assignment during my internship was to be an assistant to the coordinator of outreach. The coordinators job is to plan the outreach events from start to finish. She takes the ideas of events and makes them into real events for the surrounding high schools. As her assistant, I often filled in fo her when she could not be present, delegating tasks and creating dialogues with individuals from different departments to improve the programs for the future."
"My advanced leadership skills came out during my internship when I worked at the One Clemson auction. This organization works to sponsor the UPIC internships through the athletic department. By working with this event, thanking the sponsors, and showing them what these internships opportunities are giving me, together we pursue a shared vision of developing young students to get real work experience before graduating."
My adviser was debugging a fault and immediately assigned emergency responsibilities to analyze various parameters responsible for the fault
My advisor combined me with another student in our office to create drop-in hours and other information sessions for students. We were placed together because her program and my program (CISabroad) have very similar trips to Australia and New Zealand that allowed us to inform students on both our programs. This also helped get other students thinking about studying abroad even if it wasn't through our two programs.
"My belief is that a leadership comes in many forms, and that everyone's definition of leadership varies. Often people associate leadership with position, but in reality, that is not necessarily true. Just because I serve as an intern, I can still demonstrate leadership qualities. Several times this semester, I have been able to lead the group of interns in the office to achieve a common goal. I served as the communications director for the Study Abroad Ambassadors, and through that position I was able to coordinate and execute a plan for the ""It's not too late to study abroad"" campaign. By assigning individual action items for each team member and creating a check-off sheet for all of them to achieve those tasks let to a more productive work environment and a successful attempt to exceed our study abroad numbers from last spring."
"My biggest project, same as above, allowed me to work with a wide array of people with many backgrounds to come towards a common goal of putting forth communication about a new initiative on campus. "
My boss always conducts meetings every Monday at 9:30 to review our goals for the previous week and discussing our goals for the upcoming week.

My boss does a very good job assigning projects to people based on their strengths and unique educational backgrounds while pushing them to always improve and broaden their capabilities.
"My boss gave me a task, and assigned me the responsibility of completing it with the other interns. Instead of telling them what needs to be done, I tried to make a discussion in terms of how everyone thinks we should approach the assignment. This helped everyone give their opinion on how they wanted to go about it, and we were able to get it done more efficiently."
My boss has a small committee of extension agents that she meets with 4 times a year. They come together to discuss how Regulatory can work better with Extension. 
My boss held weekly meetings and monthly one on one meetings to motivate our department to have a certain approval rate on our test reports to increase the efficiency and efficacy of our department 
My boss helps with the College of Science student ambassadors and she developed a group of diverse students to help promote and enlighten people about the different majors college of science has to offer. They all have the same goal to lead and bring in more students. 
My boss is a good leader and understands peoples backgrounds and how they work. Some of the people in my department work better alone so he is understanding and allows them to go work where they are most productive.
"My boss is in charge of the student ambassadors. They help the college of science out by being mentors, helping with orientations, being a voice for the student body and many other small tasks. I saw my mentor, Harolynn, lead these students to all understand the goal they are trying to achieve. I have watched her and even helped her develop the student ambassadors and the different things they would be doing this semester. "
My boss Lisa Jackson has shown me the path to being great mentor by just the way she treats the ones around the office. 
My boss often headed projects and was good at communicating what needed to be done.
"My boss Rosie is an incredible leaders, she handles the business development side of Trinity Sport. This includes camps, bookings, social media, promotions, and membership so she has lots to look after. She has a team of employees and interns that she is responsible for and does a wonderful job empowering each of us and delegating work efficiently and smartly. I have been watching her keenly to learn from her leadership skills each time we have a team project. "
My boss was having a hard time developing the pesticide license exam and she called in an inspector and I got to see them first hand work together. They used their backgrounds to build an exam that would cover the important topics and make it moderately challenging.
My boss would give me a list of chores that needed to be done before we left work and it was my job to split people up and make sure everything got done in a timely manner 
"My boss, being a German-American, often had to recognize and respect the unique strengths of individuals from all backgrounds."
"My boss, Joe, noticed the innate differences between his two UPIC interns and gave us projects that would allow us to flourish as designers. For example, he gave me jobs requiring illustration and graphic design, and gave my coworker Ethan projects that required extreme precision, organization, and record-keeping."
"My boss, Lax, continually opens the dialogue between employees and capitalizes on their great qualities and strengths in front of others and in groups to open up possibilities for overlap in employees working on projects together. "
My current mentor is new and she did a very good job transitioning in and getting to know all of us well so that we may work efficiently and comfortably together. 
"My department works with a company TransVoyant, to foresee exactly what shipments there are flying to South Africa and China. I was fortunate to build a relationship with TransVoyant and work out problems on both sides to form a better partnership."
"My direct report was Tina Homer, a guardianship clerk. She directed all of the interns during various projects in order to improve the efficiency of the probate court. "
"My entire internship centered around my ability to encourage discussion among individuals (mainly professors). One particular story that pertains to this interview question is my meeting with Dr. Rajedra Bordia (professor and chair of the materials science and engineering department) at the beginning of the semester. I explained to him my intentions of getting the entire department involved in the updating of content on the website and he agreed that this would be the most effective way of creating a better webpage for the department. After our meeting, he sent out an email to every professor in the department asking if anyone had relevant content or suggestions on how to make the website better as well as my contact information. This created a platform for professors and other members of the department to get in contact with me to voice their opinions and communicate relevant information. "
"My entire UPIC Magazine project was based on impressing the main stakeholders — UPIC administration and the university. Throughout the project, I had to constantly keep in contact and update UPIC administrators on the progress of the project and make sure that what we were doing was in line with their vision."
My experience with ARCADIS taught me that anyone could be a leader. The responsibility I was given strengthened my self-confidence and improved the quality of my output. That response made me a better team member and a better worker in all aspects of my life.
-My first semester as an intern -Didn’t really have any leadership responsibilities -Just getting to know the people and the facility and how things are run 
"My host/supervisor in the company is the team lead for this project and I observed how he coordinated with full time employees and other interns in order to combine all the individual knowledge, skills, background and tasks in such a way that in totality the project turns out to be a success. "
"My interns and I were assigned a film that we needed to each review and give feedback/coverage on. I encouraged all of us to each watch it and make notes and then we would return the next day and have a full discussion about the film and truly flesh out everything we could. After, we would compile our concrete findings into a presentation for our boss to then pass on to the client. It was important that we all took it seriously and gave useful feedback. We were able to create something we were all proud of and succeeded in our goal of making something we were all proud of a in a truly collaborative way. We now do this with all of our screenings to get the most effective feedback. "
"My internship did not allow me much leadership opportunity because of the intricate hierarchy of the company; however, the leaders at Disney are amazing at creating magic every day for guests of all different backgrounds. I have seen very angry guests speak to my managers and by the end of the conversation they are happy guests once again. My leaders capitalize on all of the strengths of my coworkers to help the restaurant flow smoothly, but also capitalize on the strengths of the guests to make them feel like winners as well."
"My internship did not entail a lot of leadership roles, however, I was very lucky to be able to work alongside many great leaders throughout my time at IPTAY. One great example would be our CEO, Davis Babb. Most of my interactions with Mr. Babb came from our Monday morning staff meetings. He was very effective in making sure that every voice in the room was heard (including mine), and took viewpoints from all different departments and backgrounds and into consideration when any kind of debate was going on. He always had a way of asking the right questions to get the most out of an idea or a topic, and knew how to balance differing opinions in order to reach the best possible conclusion for the group."
My internship was all online so I did not see much leadership or discussion. My mentor was very supportive for me.
"My internship was based less in sharing ideas than in completing tasks as necessary. Our shared vision was to promote the University, and we had to do that in every aspect of our job. Occasionally that goal was hard to achieve. For instance, we had to run a story about the director of parking services, and we had to debate whether or not to portray him in a good light (leaving out the outrage over parking on campus), or to be honest about the way that parking services needs to improve to meet the needs of students and faculty. This discussion had to be open and everyone had to share their views. In the end, honesty won out. "
"My job here was usually a one man job if I was not collaborating with other groups. In collaboration, leadership was required to get the job done and make sure I that what I am creating is what they want. "
My leadership skills have improved greatly over the past semester. I have become more confident with corrective action. I was able to talk to students and let them know what mistakes they have made and I was able to avoid conflict.
My leadership skills were definitely enhanced because I had to learn how to be a better example since I was one of the top managers. I also had to learn how to be assertive in instances when another person was not abiding by our policies.
"My leadership wasn't showcased necessarily in a group setting, considering we never had group projects with other coworkers. My leadership was more showcased in my ability to be reliable and communicate. Getting assignments done in a timely manner and communicating updates frequently."
My manager (Rory Marsoun) showed exceptional leadership skills during the course of this internship. He discussed my strengths and areas of improvement with me during review. He also pro-actively asked me to think of projects that I would like to pursue for my interest.
"My manager and I were constantly discussing ways to improve the office environment and its organization to best suit the needs of our employees. I was very attentive of everyone's behavior and habits, so that I could come up with improvements. Then, we would collaborate with one another to come up with the best solution. "
My manager grouped me and 2 other interns together for the locker project and helped us lay out a plan to create a functioning demo.
My manager lead her team in discussions about hiring another intern for the next semester. Some people in the group had differing opinions on who they should hire. My manager took everyone’s opinions seriously and discussed each candidates merits. She eventually led them to a consensus and selected the intern to hire for next semester. 
My manager often had to instruct coworkers and me on what to do if he had to step away. He had to be clear so that we knew what to do. 
My mentees usually look to me to act as their leader when we're all together. 
My mentor allowed me to take a lead intern role this summer so I was able to help both my team and my mentor accomplish group assignments or personal assignments we were given. 
"My mentor and I communicated with the alumni association prior to the 100th anniversary in order to get ideas from them for our banners. We contributed our ideas, and I contributed mine and was open to change. We ended up taking what they had recommended and further exploring ideas with Campus Banner and Design."
"My mentor and I started the summer with 1:1 meetings every week and we more recently started including one of the graduate assistants (whom I've worked and communicated with most after my mentor) in our weekly meetings. In these meetings, my mentor is able to lead the meeting very well by opening with questions about our lives as a little warm-up, and she asks individual questions referencing specific things that she remembers about each of us. She then continues to mostly speak with me, since the GA's main purpose in the meetings is to shadow, and she makes me feel very comfortable with how she speaks, asks questions, and provides feedback on my projects."
My mentor assigned individual tasks to all the interns so that we could complete projects as efficiently as possible.
My mentor constantly provided this positive feedback for me in my internship
My mentor definitely exhibited leadership throughout this semester by being able to lead our AOD team in the incentives push for the NCHA. Each of us had a significant role to play because we each had numerous connections. She effectively delegated tasks to us to do.
"My mentor demonstrated this in how he handled all of the interns. Everyone was treated equal, and was able to be themselves and provide their own unique work. "
MY MENTOR GAVE ME THAT FEEDBACK TOWARDS THE END OF THE INTERN AND I LOOK FORWARD TO IMPROVE.
"My mentor had asked me to begin a layout for the Watt Center Annual Report, and we went back and forth with different ideas we had for color templates and infographics. I continually asked for feedback from her and from my other co-workers and encouraged them to contribute ideas as well so I could achieve a cohesive design that pleased everyone. "
My mentor has always called out great work done by her coworkers. They all praise each other and support one another. 
My mentor has once take me a meeting with clients to talk about requirements and specifications for the website they need. The clients often have an idea of what they want and the theme of what it should be. However they also do not understand exactly the technology and difficulty needed to design what they want. The mentor need to guide the clients on what we can or cannot do while trying to follow their requirements the best he can.
"My mentor has to accommodate different views for all of his work, since people from each of the departments in the College of Science have different visions for flyers, etc."
"My mentor is a great leader and made sure all her interns, Morgan and I, worked together making training videos by filming and delivering the best message to the new employees."
"My mentor is a very effective leader, and one of the methods which he best leverages is using peoples's unique strengths. When I was working on collaborative code with a partner, my mentor made sure that each of us were doing things that we were best suited to do. I, for example, was assigned to a part of the project which focused on reading in data and modifying it, whereas my partner was focused on code that analyzes the text data that I organize."
"My mentor is at the heart of the entire design team and she is responsible for the planning of the entire hospital design. When we have any questions about the function of the building's plan, she will communicate with us in a timely manner, and we will discuss the work of the past week and the work we need to do next week in each weekly team meeting."
"My mentor is especially good at capitalizing on my strengths and recognizing things that I should work on. She has given me several tasks she knew I could do but would challenge me. But on the other hand she has also given me tasks, like making quick edits to our logo when a sponsor needs specific dimensions or a transparent background or a different file type. She is able to recognize that asking someone else will take time where as I’m available and can get things back to her quickly. Melissa, the director, has also been able to capitalize on my strength of having an artistic eye and being a perfectionist. Whenever she is creating marketing material, she asks me to look at it and make adjustments to format, colors, fonts, arrangement, text, etc. "
My mentor is good at seeing people's strengths and weaknesses and putting them in a position they excel in rather than struggle.
"My mentor is involved in managing several enterprises so he was often out at other businesses or in meetings. Due to this I sometimes assisted staff on the retail floor by interacting with customers and answering inquiries. During one of these days I noticed that the layout of our travel section, sunhats, hydration section, and socks were not organized efficiently. Myself and two other staff members moved the stock around to make it easier for customers to find the travel and hydration offerings due to them being popular and a large source of revenue. Although we made them more visible by moving them more towards the center of the customer's view of the store they also were moved back. This meant the customer had to pass most of the products on the ground floor to get to the product they were looking forward. We hoped this would increase the chances of a product catching a customer's eye."
My mentor is the acting manager of the Architectural design team and she is incredible in leading the team to complete a shared goal in a timely manner. I gained many leadership skills from her and it encourages me to take on more leadership positions. 
"My mentor ius really great at getting people to work together, especially within our lab."
My mentor Lydia does a good job of playing on each of our strengths but also challenging us to work on our weaknesses.

"My mentor Mark Jensen actively points his interns towards jobs that are more towards their strengths. For instance, I'm better at coding than working at hardware, so I'm usually given the coding projects for the semester. "

"My mentor Terri has to communicate with all people within the department on a daily basis because she handles so much of the administrative work. It seems like it can be challenging at times, because there are language and culture barriers, as well as age barriers. She caters to all of this and is mindful of all of it as a leader"
My mentor used great leadership skills utilizing her interns in effective ways to get projects done. She would draw on the strengths of each intern and put them in roles to capitalize on the skills and knowledge they had. There were many opportunites in the workplace for us to excel in something that we had talent in.
My mentor was a good example of this. Whenever he implemented something new he had the talent to convince everyone about this.
"My mentor was a great leader and got different people together all the time. For every marketing campaign we did, she brought together people who had different strengths to complement each other. "
My mentor was able to capitalize on our strengths and weaknesses by assigning us different tasks to do that some many be better at or are more experienced at but also assigning us each a different inventory that we had to keep track of throughout the entire summer.

She has been able to use these differences as strengths and has tailored her supervision style to make sure that we both are being supervised and lead in ways that are most suitable for our personalities."
"My mentor, Dr. Hudson Smith, is a great example of moral, strategic, and effective leadership. He treated all of us interns as individuals and delegated tasks based on our strengths. He even varied his communication style with each of us to connect on a personal level. For example, when speaking to one of the other interns, he would use direct and factual language. In contrast, when speaking with me, Hudson would use encouraging and softer language. "
"My mentor, is frequently doing this. In the past weeks i have seen him include individuals in conversations that he knew their talents would be capitalized and the conversation would benefit from having those skills/viewpoints. "
"My mentor, Jackie, was always recognizing her interns for the great work that we were producing. She was constantly going out of her way to tell us that we did a good job.

She would write the articles for the Meet a Tiger and I produced the video portion. "
"My mentor, Joe Robbins, recognized my strengths in print design and deliberately gave me projects that capitalized upon this strength."

"My mentor, when I came to this program, introduced me to his graduate students and his summer workers. He told me about each of their strengths and how much he depends on them. He showed me that he trusts his workers and grad students and that he's able to give them responsibilities that they will follow through on. "
"My mentors were both great. For my science internship, Jim Melvin directed three interns to work together as a unit. He always made sure we were on the same page and met with us informally almost every day. For my campusrec internship, Kelly Ator was the best. She not only helped professionally, but personally as well. She met with us early and set goals for us that she helped us attain. She also met with us and ran us through personality tests so we understand what type of worker/ person we are. She met with us weekly to talk about goals for the week and anything else we wanted. "
"My mentors worked with me to find my strengths. As my internship is physics heavy, I am not familiar with a lot of the terminology, but I do take an interest in the health physics side of it, so my mentors took the time to talk to me about the health physics side of my internship."
My portion of the pecan workshop gave the participants knowledge of how to identify and treat the problems they may face with their pecan trees. I presented them with research based information that would allow them to produce more pecans each year and keep their trees healthy. This aligns with the Extension goal of providing the community with information that improves their lives. 
"My primary project was the design and development of a modular shelving system meant to hold electrical cables for rapid and easy testing. This project required coordinating the requirements of the testing engineers, the engineers who's parts were to be tested, and the fabricators who would be building the shelf. The key to this endeavor was keeping in constant communication with each party to ensure that everyone's needs were being met and everyone was on the same page."
"My proficiency with leadership has excelled to the intermediate level. Often times when working in marketing for a new company is means offering insight about things you would do differently or change. Coming into CU-ICAR, I felt that their social media was lacking in a few areas. I was a little apprehensive to share my new ideas with the team, because I was afraid of the response that I would receive. I had to overcome this fear and share the ideas with the team and provide them with creative insight as to how CU-ICAR would benefit with the changes that I would like to implement. When presenting my ideas I created an open space for advice where my fellow team members could give me constructive criticism and insight to their opinions. After creating an environment like this everyone can learn from each other. "
"My project lacked focus for a good part of the internship. However, I have eventually taken the initiative and convinced others to accept my vision."
"My responsibility includes answering emails for all the users that using this open source product -- indeed lot of people ask vague questions -- rather than immediately start to answer those vague questions, To lead the conversation, I'd like to provide them meaningful information of this product, in order to help us to converge to one or two specific questions. Sometimes I'll ask them the reason why they want to do a certain thing, or sometimes I'll just ask them for more information, etc. Then based on the their goal, I will provide the capability for the open source product. If we find some agreement, then we'll dig through it to shape a solution/idea. "
"My site mentor is a role model and leader in my field and someone that I look up to and respect. I witnessed him demonstrate these basic leadership qualities over and over again while at my internship. Not only would he constantly encourage me and recognize my talent, giving me the time and resources that I needed to continue to develop as an aspiring human factors practitioner, but I also observed how he does this with all employees at the center. From the summer interns that he took on, including myself, to the most senior researchers at the center – he is very skilled at fostering growth and professional development amongst the employees that work for him while also staying on top of his many responsibilities and tight schedule. He ensures that his employees and colleagues are getting what they need in order to grow in their job roles and careers and it was a pleasure to be a part of this throughout my limited time working at MedStar."
"My site mentor is the leader of our team with 14 people. We are going to release a version of our firewall product. My site mentor check with each people individually about their progress.

She recognized that I had an ease with being on camera and communicating with people, while Jessie was superb at the editing and formatting of the videos, wherein I struggled. Under her guidance we were able to most efficiently conquer the task at hand. "
"My site mentor, Jennifer, developed many groups and held a leadership role in each group while I was interning under her. I saw her be a very effective leader of very different groups and goals, and I think she is a very inspiring leader. Jennifer leads groups within Healthy Campus to achieve various goals about mental health awareness, green/environmentally friendly initiatives, and improved wellness on campus. She also leads a small group within the Sustainability Commission to achieve the goal of updating the Sustainability Action Plan, which I was able to work on as well. Jennifer has been a very effective leader on this initiative and has collaborated with me, other students, and members of the Sustainability Commission. "
"My story for this one is a bit of a touchy topic with my department, and I cannot take full credit for how the situation came about, or how it was handled. At the beginning of the semester, I began hearing discussions/complaints between coworkers regarding compensation. At first, I didn't feel this was a serious issue, but as time went on, more and more people mentioned this to me, my counterpart (Quinton), and another coworker (will remain nameless). After we had a full operations staff meeting one night, the three of us sat down with our new supervisor and discussed the issue of several very skilled staff members feeling they were being underpaid for the work they do, and were considering seeking employment elsewhere. After hours of discussion, my coworker felt it was best to create a group chat with all that felt they were underpaid, and added Quinton and me to it as well. In this group chat, everyone was encouraged to express their opinions, why they felt the way that they did, and what they felt would be the best solution. Quinton and I, who work closely with our full-time staff members facilitated the questions and assured everyone that their concerns were being heard, even if they felt nothing was being done about it. While all of this was going on, our supervisor was working on finding a short term solution to ease the tension while other full-time staff work on finding a more long-term solution. At the end of the day, I feel the group chat was a great way to ease tension and make people feel like they were actually being listened to while a solution was worked out."
My supervisor and I often discussed different manners of presenting the material within the videos during our planning stages for each.
My supervisor and other colleagues worked on different aspects of the same project and got done with multiple projects in just 2 months .
My supervisor assigned different works to different co-workers according to their background and expertise. Some of them are experts in programming while others are doing well in algorithm design. The synergy made our work efficiency better.

My supervisor brought together students from various majors and social groups to develop a plan for getting students more involved at Brooks.
"My supervisor call all the people to form a team to work on projects together and based on his leadership, everyone have their own role and task and work together for the same goal."
"My supervisor developed a team of 6 people including me and another intern to make a new physical model for the project, but at the same time he still need to coordinated with the builder and client to check the progress of construction."
"My supervisor developed a team of interns and student workers to complete several different tasks. Based on our previous experience, we were assigned different roles. We have a group leader who keeps up with data and reports. Our supervisor recognized each member's skills and abilities as they apply to our big projects. He respects us as we respect him. He develops our group to work together quick and efficiently."
My supervisor does a great job on drawing on the different strengths of me and her other intern. We are able to divide different projects and jobs based on our strengths. 
My supervisor does that and he macro manages his teams to meet company goals regularly.

By doing this, she creates a sense of open dialogue which benefits the group as a whole. We feel that all of our opinions and therefore all of our work is a valued part of the team. My supervisor's leadership makes us all feel that we play important roles in the work we do for her. "
My supervisor gathered a group together to work on updating our website and all of our faculty scholar profiles. She separated the work among us by putting me in charge of figuring out which computer program would work best for us to design a database to keep track of changes. She then assigned tasks to the others based on what she saw as their strengths.
"My supervisor gave each project to employees based on their best skills. Some projects, like the highly technical baseball projects, were better completed by students that already had a background in baseball and were familiar in terminology. Other projects, like the Fanatics sales project, were better completed by students that had a business and marketing background. Accounting for the diverse backgrounds of students helped each project to be as successful as possible."
"My supervisor had to speak about what PEER WISE is and does to students and parents at the event that we hosted. Instead of giving them exactly what PEER WISE does, she had each student that works in the PEER WISE office as a mentor, a tutor, or an assistant come up to the stage to speak about how PEER WISE has impacted them and helped them as a student at Clemson."
My supervisor Holly is a great example of a wonderful leader that encourages everyone to be the best employee they can. She explained things in a way that everyone understood and she made sure to take the time to explain something if I didn't understand. She was always willing to listen to everyone's opinions and ideas on future social content and promotions. I can't thank her enough for being such a wonderful example of the leader I hope to be one day. And words will never describe how grateful I am for this wonderful opportunity.

My supervisor knew that I was proficient in MS Excel and capitalized that strength of mine.
My supervisor listens to all ideas and do not dismiss them. We usually go through ideas and expand on them to see what the best approach should be.

Also because I have been in my position for a year, I have been able to have more responsibility in directing and delegating new interns to complete projects or provide instructions."
My supervisor Nathan helped me multiple times with projects that I had messed up on. I had a big problem with learning the steps of production and mastering the production processes. Nathan was always there to help and fix whatever I had messed up on. 
"My supervisor organized me into a group with another person working on a different project than me, so that we could both get experience and learn from each other. "
"My supervisor oversees all interns. She tracks each projects' progress and support interns in their interaction with research experts. Since the Research-to-Policy Collaboration works on an array of social issues, interns have the opportunity to choose to work on a topic that they already feel passionate about or one that they've been wanting to explore but haven't had the chance; a topic of which they are experts or one that they want to learn about. She gives room for the interns to explore the topics and tasks while also supporting them throughout the process. "
My supervisor recognized the strengths of each student and professional on a daily basis and tailored the day's goals on the given volunteers´ abilities. One time we had two dentists volunteer at an elementary school and I was given the task of sanitizing the equipment.

My supervisor took benefit of my programming skills to create innovative software which documents data during failures and aids debugging
"My supervisor used everyone in the office's strengths to create successful events. For example, when organizing the OLLI community yard sale I was asked to create press information, the other intern was asked to create graphic and posters, and my co-worker was asked to find and organize people participating. "
My supervisor used to assign task to people based on their skill sets. If it was tech related she would assign IT to do it and so on.
My supervisor used to conduct timely meetings about the project review and there my leadership skills got enhanced as I had to give presentation about the work which I had been doing and prepare power-point presentation on the same.
"My supervisor was the spearhead of the Walk SC Program, as she proposed the idea after seeing a similar program in Texas. Because of this, I was able to be included in every step of the design process for this program. My mentor capitalized on the unique strengths of her employees and interns in a productive manner. For example, she tasked one of her Extension agents to make instructive work out videos for varying difficulty levels. She assigned this specific duty to an agent that is a certified personal trainer. To record the videos, she assigned me because I could easily work with the technology needed to edit and distribute the videos. She utilized another agent to promote the idea around campus which lead to the president of Clemson getting involved. Without employing her resources to jobs which best suited their interests and abilities, this new program would not have turned out as successful as it is going to be. "
My supervisor was very adept at leveraging the knowledge and expertise of blue collar technicians at the assembly shop floor. He would encourage engineers to ask for their feedback routinely while designing parts and assemblies. Our engineering team had a very harmonic relationship with these shop technicians which was beneficial to everyone. Interns were also encouraged to express ideas as he wanted fresh perspectives on things and he respected everyone's opinions.
"My supervisor would check in once or twice a week with everyone on the team about their goals for the day/week and how they were going to achieve it or why they hadn't achieved it yet, and how it applied to whatever larger project was being worked on."
My supervisor would connect me with other videographers and people from other organizations that we would be working with. He would introduce us and describe what the end goal was.
My supervisor would go through my summaries with a fine tooth comb to hone my writing skills.
"My supervisor, Jackie, is a really good example of this and that’s why I like working for her. She takes each intern’s skills into consideration when planning projects like Meet a Tiger. She used my skills in organization and scheduling to plan dates and times for the shoots. Owen’s skill with video were utilized as well, including our other intern, Mikayla’s, skill with social media (which was used to promote each segment). She respected each of our skills as individuals and capitalized on them to create a final product that was better than anything any of us could have made by ourselves. "
"My supervisor, Lisa Jackson, does a great job at being a leader. She is a great example of what a leader should be like. She encourages all of us when we have a creative idea and is quite flexible and understanding. During our group meetings she allows us all to speak and be part of the dialogue."
"My supervisor, Mr. Brendan Sherry is one of the leaders I can look up to. Along with the project lead, he is also the department head. He organizes informal departmental meeting every week through which everyone is allowed to share his/her work and issues they are facing. It results in healthy discussion on several topics which may be of use to someone in future. "
"My supervisor, Ms. Jackson, Lead our group of PEER mentors every week at staff meetings. And I particularly remember her leading the group towards improving the organization by encouraging us to Lead committees within PEER that would enhance our visibility on campus throughout the semester."
"My supervisor, Tim Dickson, displayed excellent leadership skills when we had to install a tv monitor in Vickery hall and also run cabling through a table. He instructed the team on how to do each task and was able to answer questions when somebody was confused as to how something should be solved. For instance, when installing the first tv monitor it wouldn't mount to the wall well and as a team we solved it together. Tim then took note of this and applied it to other buildings on campus when the same kind of monitor would be installed."
My team lead needed me to perform a dual role as Supplier Industrialisation Engineer & Global Supply Chain Manager in my team. My mentor recognized my skills and Interest in SIE role and encouraged me to take more responsibilities in Supplier Quality Field than Purchasing field. I not only got the opportunity to understand both the roles but also facilitated to learn nuances in the field.
My two coworkers constantly disagreed and so throughout the internship I turned into a mediator for the two of them and was able to re-align our objectives to get back on track.
My work got nominated to be presented at Tuscan intern conference where only few interns get the chance to present there.
"My work team holds weekly meetings to handle business of the lab, regular project updates and discuss new discoveries in the field. This meeting has allowed me to spark open and honest discussion between my coworkers about the projects that we are working on. "
"Myself and another lab member are working on different projects, but the method of going about them is the same. I have been a couple of steps ahead of her in the lab, so I can help her with her project since I have done it already. We can work together to figure out what to do if we run into issues. Additionally, if I am successful, I can explain what worked for me if she is experiencing issues with the protocol that I had as well."
Myself and my fellow intern were put in charge of a project of lowering manure moisture. At one point during the project we set up a meeting with between ourselves and our boss and supervisor. In this meeting I encouraged all of us to share ideas to figure out a way to move the project forward. Certain members were stuck on points of the project but having multiple perspectives was useful in allowing us to move forward.

"Near the beginning of my internship, I was pushing for the creation of an Instagram account to better reach Clemson students. I knew that our department had tried and failed to have an account a few years earlier, so I reached out to my mentor and his boss to have a meeting discussing the pros and cons of creating and instagram, as well to create a defined outline of what we wanted our CCIT brand to be. Through the discussion of our varying ideas, we came up with a plan to meet our common goals as a department."
"Near the end of my semester I attending the club sports Leadership Series community service night. My mentor, Emily, organized this event for all of the club sports captains and presidents to attend. A speaker then came to talk to the group about how their individual skill sets can be used to make a difference in the community. After the speaker, the group was lead in multiple service projects, requiring them all to work together, but also put their personal touch on these projects. It was cool to see how my mentor, just one person, was able to put this whole event together which helped teams help others. "
Nearly every day my mentor and I discussed different points of views on our website. Specifically we would talk about different ways to implement our resources page. We both came to a conclusion of a mixture of both of our ideas because that would better suit the website and make it more effective at its purpose.
"New employee training offers a ton of leadership experience. Some concepts you have to really explain so that employees can learn good troubleshooting habits, but some duties can be explained broadly. Also for this, I feel that you have to develop your own training style based on what has worked before and what has not worked. I used past manager guidelines to develop my training style which is more employee driven, after initial information has been given. With training, you can also see which employees pick up concepts quicker than others which usually results in good manager candidates and/or special event technicians."
"No situations over the summer where I had to take a leadership role, other than making sure what I need to finish was completed"
"Not in this rotation, but in my previous rotation, I was given the opportunity to lead a group of high school students from around the country for a week in our facility to learn about electron microscopy. I was encouraged them to talk about what they could do together to solve some of the problems we gave them."
Not much leaderwork for me.
Not very much as an intern.
"NREL is a company that is incredibly aligned with their mission and goals towards renewable energy. Each center is highly dedicated to pursuing the best scientific advances to prolong our energy security. My site manager, Gregg Beckham, is a highly prolific researcher here. He aggressively and intelligently pursues projects that have high potential to make an immediate impact on the world. Gregg does a really good job keeping us on track. He makes sure we explore interesting offshoots to our data without getting lost in rabbit holes. He is very good at identifying which pursuits are worthwhile. "
Often during meetings with other interns or mentors we would have differing ideas about what we should do for certain events and we needed to work together in order to come up with solutions to these issues. 
Often I was given projects that required collaboration and discussion before I decided upon the final product. When I was faced with creating the brochures I brought them up in a meeting and chose to ask opinions and create a discussion about what was most important or vital to be included and what could go. 
"Often in our group projects, we debated the best ways to get certain jobs done, during these discussions we it was important that mutual respect for each other's ideas and opinions was maintained to ensure that we continued to function well as a team."
"Often times during the internship it was very important for me to rely messages and orders from my mentor and other superiors to the volunteers and students that were working under me. As mentioned above this was especially true during Strike, when I was directly responsible for a group of workers as well as responsible for delegating a large amount of work among others."
"Often times in our team meetings, we would all contribute on certain issues and provide a different view on how to solve certain issues, such as people not signing in or logging their 3D printed parts. We would all offer different ideas from each other."
"Often times in our weekly meetings with our head supervisor. A lot of information would be presented and there were several different comments, suggestions, and feedback that was provided in order to help the colleague. I believe that our head supervisor did a good job reaching out to different people as he knew their strengths and weaknesses and was able to highlight on them, in order to help me. "
Often we have had to work to share the vision and mission of the Faculty Senate. One way I work to do this is through our rebranding of the website. 
"Oftentimes, other interns and I would exchange ideas or ask for potentially useful advice and unique input. This allowed for multiple perspectives on problems and solutions to be exchanged in order to lead ourselves to success. I encouraged this type of communication as it was beneficial to all parties."
"Oftentimes, other interns and I would exchange ideas or ask for potentially useful advice. At one time, another intern and I created a small side project that we had talked about potentially doing. Although it fell through, this task created a necessity for leadership in order to move the side project forward and develop it into a potentially viable product."
"On couple of occasions, I came up with some plans which were different from what my mentor was envisaging, and those ideas were slightly more far sighted. Also, my mentor appreciated those plans. "

"On Monday, November 26, 2018, I hosted (along with the other Clemson Abroad LdM intern) an LdM specific orientation session for students traveling to LdM in Spring 2019. During this session, the other LdM intern and I greatly empowered these students by providing our own helpful tips and experiences during our own semesters abroad in Florence, and we allowed the students to better understand that our successful times abroad could also be theirs next semester."
"On multiple projects, I took the lead on beginning them and seeing them through to completion."
"On my recent project, I would put on the project to help another UPIC intern with flow cytometry. I did not know what flow cytometry was prior to the project because it is not apart of my major, but my supervisor believed I could do the prep work and analysis of it. My supervisor saw skills I did not know I possess and allowed me to develop them throughout the semester."
"On one occasion, I was sent with other interns to lead a large group of volunteers to clean a school. We were to meet them there and spearhead the project. I met with school administration to find out what needed to be done, ad called an intern meeting. With the new information, we discussed how to best divide up the volunteers, who was to lead each smaller group, and what they would be doing. We also decided what supplies to bring with us to the school. Because we had several groups of volunteers with us, we did not initially agree on how to divide them up. I suggested that we split up the groups in order to promote a collaborative atmosphere and build relationships. Our Operations Intern, Argo, suggested that we keep a family of volunteers together so that the parents could keep an eye on their kids. To compromise, we decided to split up the other volunteer groups but keep the family together. This worked well, and we ended up finishing early because the groups worked well together. "
"On our first day, we all joined a video chat where we all got together to see what tasks we all were going to do throughout the semester."
"On several projects and committees, the WISE Coordinator had to delegate jobs to our staff in ways that all mentors' strengths were recognized."
"On that day that the power went out, Mark had to get us all together and tell us what needed to be done once we found out which computers where actually down. "
"On the actual day of Legacy Day, I enlisted the help of my fellow interns to help me cover the event. I had to delegate the work among us and assign each of them specific tasks to do. Without their help, it would have been a very overwhelming day, so I made sure to tell them how much I appreciated having them there. "
"On the drive back from adventure trips, I led/ facilitated discussion on what people thought of the experience"
"On the first day of my internship, there was a yearly inventory check done by a 3rd party. I had to guide him through all the different floors and rooms even though I personally had never been through before. Regardless, I was able to explain my situation clearly and help him go through his list. He explained to me how he normally does things, and I tried to follow suit. "
"On the Social Strategy Team we have interns from different departments. A lot of the projects that we do takes a little bit from each department- the writers create a script, the graphics interns make the logos and the introduction clips, and the video interns capture the visual material and make it into a piece to be shared out on social channels. Other times we work together to create Instagram stories as well. Our supervisor does a good job of distributing the work so that each person's talents can really shine. "

"On Thursday morning we have a foreman meeting where all of the lead subs come up to the office and during that time we sit down and discuss what everyone had planned for the upcoming week. During this time I facilitate the discussion in order that the ultimate goal is met of progressing the building process, all while maintaining a safe working environment. "
"Once a week, we had a ""team meeting"" that consisted of myself, my mentor, and my coworker. During this meeting, we would throw out ideas of how to strengthen the social media and Meet A Tiger. We were each able to help each other, connect together verbally and through a plan so that we knew what was expected over the course of the summer."
"Once again, during the retreat, which was my biggest project so that is the reason that I am referencing it so much, the floor was opened for the individuals present to share their feelings about topics discussed. I spoke up many times to encourage others to do so as well. "
"Once again, I feel that my leadership quality came through with the Native Planting Workshop. As I mentioned previously, I worked extremely hard to communicate with others and then to bring their accomplishments and their skills to the table in the best way possible. I also worked to share the group's accomplishments the day of the planting to the rest of the office supporters, such as the Extension Administration, and the stakeholders of the golf course, by providing Mr. Garrett materials to provide to his membership to explain the impact and design of the garden on his course. "
"Once again, I helped our nurse practitioners become more organized and efficient by successfully creating multiple templates for William Mayo (FNP-C) and Michelle Deem (FNP-C) ."
"Once again, when I was working on the website, I was one of two student interns that were at Clemson Online. This made me the only person who had the point of view of a student, and I lead the charge on coming up with the best website design and content for the student."
Once every week or so the team would get together for a lunch where my manager would engage everyone and we would talk about the work we are doing and give relevant input to other if and when needed. 
"Once the changed in the Rear Line was made after the July 4th shutdown, it had to be agreed upon by the workers and tried out. For that the Team Leader was very important. So, the Team Lead and I decided to explain the workers what the changes were and how it had to be worked out and she was very effective in communicating what she wanted and expected from them. She told them about the incentive they would receive if they could all achieve 65 parts per hour. That same day, they ended up hitting 64 one hour and 70 the next hour. It was a great achievement. "
Once we were trying to figure out a solution as to why one of our display carts was not working correctly. I suggested every intern present come up with a possible reason for the issue and try to remedy the unit using each of our ideas until we found the solution. 
"Once when I observed my supervisor capitalize on the unique strengths of individuals was when she assigned different tasks to several different interns. I am not the only intern within my department and there are about four others who work under my mentor. At one meeting, my mentor called us all together and asked us our interests and strengths to gear us towards the right project for each of us. Instead of randomly assigning us to projects, she made sure that she understood our interests first. She developed a plan for how each of us would be involved in the department. "
"Once, another employee needed to make something for the office and he recognized that we had a unique set of skills and the means to 3D print what was needed."
One big project I was assigned this semester was to create a football dashboard for the upcoming season. This dashboard was through a software called Smartsheet and was to report information about each donor attending each home football game. I was not too familiar with this creation of an in depth dashboard so I connected with an employee on the Central Donor Relations team who had this experience. I communicated with her on what my supervisor was looking for in the dashboard and in return reported back to my supervisor on the progress of the project. 
"One challenge we encountered this semester included tasks being left incomplete for extended periods of time. To remedy this, I had a meeting with my stafff where I presented the problem and asked for their opinions and suggestions for improvement. We worked together to find a solution that worked for everyone."
"One day at the end of the day, everyone was doing their closing jobs after the park had closed. On this day, we were pulling all the chairs out of a zone so that the sand machine could go through it and make it clean. It was a large zone and we did not have much time to get it done so I acted as a leader and encouraged others to work efficiently to make sure we get the job done and accomplish our goal of clearing the entire zone in the time we had left."
"One day during the semester, some coworkers were feeling a bit lethargic when we needed to complete a room for setup. I empowered them to push through and we ended up setting up the room in a very quick manor. "
"One day we were cruising timber, our supervisor recognized that one of the other student interns was specifically good at calling tree height. He used this opportunity to help develop her strength and enable her to practice and become more knowledgeable in calling tree height and using the proper tools to improve that ability."
"One day while working in the lab at Clemson, the other undergraduate intern and I were left alone for the rest of the day because both of our mentor's had important meetings to attend. I stepped up and compiled a list of things we could get done without our mentors, and we got them all done and both of our mentors were really impressed the next day. "
"One day, all of our supervisors were participating in an OGE training, so there were only interns in the office. I was responsible for maintaining order in the office and making sure that students/parents/outside parties were assisted if they came in. A student from the NC State abroad office called and was conducting a study abroad survey and was collecting quantitative as well as qualitative data from abroad offices across the U.S. I was able to answer his questions and assist in that survey based on my two semesters of experience with the Clemson Abroad office. "
"One of Dr. Baldwin’s strengths as a mentor lies in his approach to providing guidance and explanations at vastly different levels of experience. This is clear in the research freedom he entrusts to his PhD and master’s students, in the check-ins and explanations he gives to undergraduates, and in the patient clarifications he gave to the high school student who spent a few weeks in the lab this summer gaining research experience. Although all of us have different educational backgrounds to build upon, we are all able to contribute to the goals of the lab because of Dr. Baldwin assigning projects according to experience level and how well we could grasp discussions of the topic with him. As a result, I spend most of my time performing cell culture and cell assays, as opposed to fellow undergraduate Emily Gessner’s work on reproductive inhibition in Daphnia magna with chemical exposure, a project upon which the high school student assisted. By giving us a balance of independence and supervision, we were able to grow as researchers and employees."
"One of my biggest responsibilities at the beginning of the semester was to assign all students into project groups and assign project managers to each group. This required analyzing students' skills and knowledge, and how it could apply to each group in order to determine where they would fit best. Upon assigning project managers, I had to train them and get them up to speed with what their role would require. "
"One of my colleagues respected my mentor's 30+ years of experience in technical writing, and even though she didn't always agree with what he was saying, she still heeded his recommendations because she recognized his experience as a technical writer."
One of my coworkers took a lot of the photos for the store and I was able to observe her craft and give my honest opinion. We both had the common goal of posting the new blog post and photo on instagram and we had to collaborate to achieve this. I had a vision of what I wanted the photo to look like and she was the expert photographer. We had different ideas to begin with but used communication to find common ground.
"One of my coworkers, Meriel, had another intern helping her with her project. Meriel is American and Aliya is Filipino, so I observed her adjusting her communication to make sure she could understand what she was asking. "
"One of my Co-Workers, Travis, teachings about laboratory animals and gives tours of the facility to the students. I observed him doing this on multiple occasions."
"One of my fellow interns immediately took to organizing the intern meetings. He quickly learned about how to develop meeting agendas and has run most of the meetings this year. His leadership has been appreciated, and he always strives to keep our meetings productive."
"One of my first few weeks Dr. Dye allowed me to attend, and help direct, one of the quarterly board meetings. There were several important people in attendance and I got my first real insight on how to step in and aid through minor leadership at a board meeting. "
"One of my goals for this semester was to create opportunities for the students attending the Business in Paris program to get to know one another before actually arriving in Paris. To do this, I implemented various team building and discussion points throughout the pre-departure orientation sessions where students had to find things in common which would hopefully lead to developing relationships prior to leaving for Paris. This is important because it's comforting to know the people around you before arriving in a foreign place together."
"One of my other friends (not in the internship) has an app he had been working on for a few months, he needed some advice and some direction so I suggested meeting with a potential stakeholder who could help achieve the vision. This stakeholder was one of the professional connections I had made during the internship, so I set up a meeting and fascinated a one hour discussion helping my friend figure out what his biggest road-blocks were and how my professional connection could help with overcoming those. During the discussion I helped communicate the relevant accomplishments that helped this new steak-holder get a better sense of how he was able to help."
One of my primary jobs as the intern this semester was to encourage our counselors and hold them accountable for caring for our campers intentionally and enthusiastically. At the end of the weekend we were then able to communicate how wonderful our weekend had been to the parents and caregivers of our campers (stakeholders).
One of my projects during my internship was to mange rework on a part. I had be sure that we stayed focus and met our deadline for the parts. 
One of my responsibilities is to train the new ambassadors. I implemented several interactive activities based around practicing conversations and answering questions with prospective students that included group discussions on how to approach difficult subjects or questions that get brought up. We all had the same goal of making sure each of us represent the Honors College and Clemson in the best possible way. My job was to empower them through the activities and providing them the resources necessary so that they were comfortable in achieving this common goal. 
One of my roles in project management is to help groups develop a scope and tasklist for their projects. It is important that they consider the role of their group and of CEDC and how their project aligns with the needs of the people of Haiti.
"One of my supervisors started a group dialogue with other heads of departments to determine how they could develop a program that would encourage more study abroad activity from the individual departments. This mainly meant creating a study abroad program that would appeal to students within the department based on location, classes offered, and the living accommodations. They laid out the basic expectations of such a program, and made plans to continue the dialogue in the future."
One of my supervisors utilized another intern for a specific project that involved him to write a script using Python. My supervisor picked this specific intern because of his previous experience in Python; he knew that this intern would write the script effectively.
"One of my supervisors worked with me last week, and I observed him speaking and empowering a much younger employee about their competency with import HTS codes, and praising her for her understanding. "
"One of our event planners, Mandy, lead all of us to understand the idea she had for an event. She met with maintenance and catering so they were all on the same page with set up of the tables and food. "
"One of the accomplishment of the Spirit Task Force this semester was the termination of the balloon release at football games. Despite being an extremely wasteful practice, it is something that is important in making the start of our football games the ""most exciting 30 seconds in college football"". It was so important to hear from students that see the value in this practice being a ""tradition"" as well as students who believe that its environmental consequences outweigh showmanship. In the club meeting, we had a constructive dialogue about how to replace the balloons with something equally as exciting that preserves the tradition as well as the environment. "
"One of the best examples of leadership I observed this semester as the opening of the Clemson Football Applied Science Lab. Working under the director of facilities, I was able to observe his leadership to develop this building, while also working under him to contribute to the new recovery room. It was really cool to watch a bunch of people come together to achieve the same vision. "
"One of the biggest ongoing tasks of the semester was placing an order for padfolios. It was difficult to find a company that was licensed by Clemson and could complete the order under budget. I had to pick the certain padfolio, design what would go on the padfolio, finalize pricing, coordinate shipping efforts, and lastly, place the order. I was responsible for sure the product was ordered and delivered by the time we needed it. I also needed to ensure that the image of it aligned with the brand of the UPIC office."
"One of the days we traveled out to do research, I served as a helper to my other team members once I finished collecting my own data. I was able to travel from person to person wherever I was needed to lend a hand collecting data, holding a salamander, or recording measurements. In this way, I was able to provide an efficient way to gather our data which would lead to analysis of the collected measurements in order to form conclusions about the types of habitats these endangered green salamanders are found in."
One of the engineers had to go out of town on office work and left me in charge of a machine re-qualification and I successfully made sure that the machine is moved to its new designated area and it was re-qualified for production.
"One of the Faculty-directed Program Coordinators organized several class visits to spread the word about two new Faculty-Directed Abroad Programs. She organized the class visits, explained the positives of the program to a few of us interns, and lead us to visit classes explaining the programs and also advising students about these programs. She is very passionate about the programs and relayed that to us and had us become advocates for the programs as well. "
"One of the initiative's components is the Pathfinder's program which aims to recruit post-doctoral scholars to Clemson. The idea is that they familiarize themselves with Clemson and network to learn what Clemson is all about. Unfortunately, turnout for this recruitment was low. I assisted in determining what the key objective of the program was so that we could determine who the correct points of contacts were within the administration."
"One of the initiative's components is the Pathfinder's program which seeks to recruit post-doctoral fellows to Clemson so that they can network and learn what Clemson is all about. Unfortunately, not much word has been disseminated and applications to this program is low. I assisted in determining what the key objective of the program was so that we could determine who the correct points of contacts were within the administration."
One of the interns Ashanti was creating a clothing brand called Swiff and he also befriended all of the interns. He got some of them to work together to help him out in creating a mouthguard for his apparel brand. He got someone to design the 3-d model and another person to create the logo for it.
"One of the leadership events that I attended was a question and answer session with President Clements. We were able to ask him any questions, whether it was related to Clemson or personal. Our discussion was open which was relaxing and it allowed me to realize that prominent leaders also came from somewhere. President Clements worked hard to earn the level of accomplishment and respect he deserves, but I realized that we are all just as capable of becoming influential leaders in the future."
"One of the main leaders that I work with is named Erich. When he works on projects for his team, he often asks those around him for ideas even if he already has an idea of a way something should be done. This is because he respects others opinions and values that their ideas may have a fresh and beneficial outlook on the problem at hand."
One of the major aspects of WISER is helping the girls succeed academically. I made sure my mentees were aware of resources at their disposal and I informed them of several activities/workshops that could be of their service.
"One of the managers I worked with was known for his positive demeanor and hard-work. He consistently praised team members and encouraged them when they performed well on the job. Additionally, he did an excellent job of delegating to his team and empowering people to succeed. I particularly noted some of the actions he would take, such as sending out encouraging emails or brining doughnuts on Fridays, and hope to utilize these team building tactics one day. "
One of the older interns was talking to another intern and realized that they had misinterpreted one of the policies so they recognized the problem and then made a note to follow it extra as to lead by example.
"One of the other employees worked closely with us over the course of our major project. He set the goals of the project, and checked in with us along the way to adjust the project goals as we progressed towards the finish."
One of the other interns felt uncomfortable on a microscope that is important in the facility. I went back through training with them and taught them what they needed to know to efficiently run the machine. This has allowed the other intern to help users when they struggle or have a problem.
One of the other interns in the space is also the vice-president of the Virtual Reality Club. The club is the parenting body of the Immersive Space so the Club is very important to the space. This intern took charge of presentations given on behalf of the Virtual Reality Club and really showed his leadership in that situation as well as being a leader to me and the other interns.
"One of the other interns, who I consider a good friend, often engaged with me on different styles and methods of completing an assignment. I always took into account that her views were very different from mine, and rather than view that as a weakness or attempt to change her opinions, I'd try to get her unique opinion to help move the design process forward. We would very often collaborate back and forth on designs we completed, asking each other what the other would do differently. If we weren't doing that, we would be sharing techniques on how to get started, what tools to use, or what thought processes we would use to come up with and complete a design. For instance, if we were creating covers for certain magazines, we'd be very open to discuss the emotion our respective covers would invoke, either confirming that said emotion was intended to be invoked, or offering alternatives to create the desired effect. Since we both have a considerable amount of skill in our field, changes we'd make were never too drastic, including a change in the colors we'd use or changing or removing a single element within the document, with little or no protest."
"One of the people I worked with in my internship was formerly a part of the Marines. When there was requests for remarks and introductions to be given by the president at a student veterans event, even though remarks do not typically fall under her job description, Shawn took charge of this project because she had the expertise to execute it."
One of the project managers was having a difficutlt time with one of his projects and I helped him reason through some of the potential solutions which he ended up implementing.
"One of the projects during the semester for Spiro was a video advertising the Spiro Living Learning Community for next year. My supervisor had assigned this task to one of the other interns initially. After a brief discussion between the three of us, my supervisor realized and decided that I would be better equipped to complete this task as I already had experience filming videos. He also pulled another intern onto the project to be in the video because she enjoyed public speaking and lived in the dorms where the LLC would be housed. This resulted in a better overall video and a more enjoyable experience for the interns involved. "
"One of the projects I am working on currently is a staff spotlight feature for the upcoming spring semester. In the process of doing so, I have interviewed multiple staff members of the CCPD to get their opinions on different aspects of working there. The goal in the end is to help the students relate better to the staff and encourage more student participation in the center."
"One of the projects I was involved in dealt with developing standardised work instructions for the transmission line, and once I finished the pilot instruction for the first station, I set up a meeting with my manufacturing engineer and the production supervisor to review the instructions. I also asked the production supervisor if it’s possible that an operator from the line could join the meeting because ultimately they are the end users of this instructions. And so the operator came in and we got a lot of input from him."
"One of the projects I worked on this semester was partnering with the Visual Arts ""New Media"" to make a collaborative piece in virtual reality. I had to develop leadership skills through this by not only organizing times to meet with their class but also demoing and teaching them VR programs such as Tilt Brush and Gravity Sketch, as well as fostering communication and experimentation in their work. We discussed a lot of the ways they could achieve their goals and problem-solved together."
"One of the projects I worked on was with a younger intern putting together binders of published work of physicians at GHS. We all came in thinking about doing the project differently, but I asked the other intern how she wanted to do it and then told her my opinion on what we should do. We each liked something about the other's idea, and met in the middle on what the best path was to complete the task. "
"One of the projects we worked on with Dr. Gallagher was applying to research positions. I believe that I helped facilitate an environment where my coworkers could talk to me and to each other about our applications, which often involved writing detailed essays of deeply personal experiences. At the beginning of the semester one of my co-workers was intimidated of me, but by the end, she now comes to me to help her with essay writing. My work with Dr. Mobley is more solitary, I haven't had the chance to lead anyone except myself in this position."
"One of the social media tactics I really wanted to implement this semester was making the Instagram account more personable and relatable to students. I initiated and led this project by conducting the student and faculty spotlight interviews and promoting those blog articles on the Instagram accounts, so that there would be more pictures of students on the account, rather than just flyers for events. I lead faculty members in this initiative and worked with students who wanted to see the Instagram account be revamped and I am very proud of the way the account is looking so far. "
"One of the tasks I was given during my internship was to analyze concepts that had been given to us from an outside agency. The goal was to determine if there was salvageable information in the concepts and how we could apply those to our broader goal as we look to re-brand parts of the University. It was a unique situation as thoughts needed to be shared without hurting the relationship with the agency. People had different viewpoints, however, I believe my honesty and frankness allowed for others to feel comfortable sharing their thoughts as well. "
"One of the times during the internship this semester that I had to act as a conduit to aid in aligning objectives was during the creation of the intake questionnaires for the grant. With this grant in the planning stage of development, for many weeks the group was consistently aiming each week to progress in discussion about what metrics should be obtained on the forms, in what manner should they be gathered along with when should certain questions be asked. With every member part of the discussions coming from varying backgrounds, often times discussions would get sidetracked for the entirety of the meeting. After two meetings becoming sidetracked in this manner, I realized in the interest of progressing forward, it was imperative that I gained control of the conversation to guide it in the manner needed to start making conclusions. Through controlling the meeting both through the agenda and the length of topical discussions, in one meeting, the group was able to come to decisive choices on the intake forms. "
One of the times when I was left in charge of overseeing a setup for a big company my peers asked me what to do and I help lead them in the right direction for an optimal experience for the customer. 
"One part of my internship was completing a resources list for our health coaches to use to assist our participants with resource navigation within the community. Part of the development of this list was to meet with various members of our team to discuss ideas as to what should be included and what the overall end goal was. As leader of this project, I was tasked with the facilitation of the discussions surrounding this project. At times it was difficult to come to any conclusions surrounding this topic because of all of the various ideas that were being discussed. However, through careful navigation of the conversation, I was able to help the group reach a consensus about what we wanted this project to look like. "
"One person in my work place is very careful in doing things. At first she was assigned to make models for our projects. Later on, my supervisor found her more good at documenting and marketing so he decided to assign her different work that she was more good at."
"one person who was also having the internship knew Spanish. After the manager knew her strength, she was assigned to help with the customer service team to answer phone calls and help the company do some Spanish translation. "
One situation I specifically remember encouraging discussion with others was when I needed others to express their opinions and suggestions for a template I was working on. I wanted it to look professional and appealing so group discussion helped me accomplish this task. 
"One time in the immersive space I collaborated with Jarrod Barnes and the student athlete interns he works with, and they used a public speaking application to help foster better speaking habits and to work on their delivery. While demonstrating the technology, Jarrod was very helpful and guided his students through the process very smoothly, while fostering confidence in each of them. He allowed each student to go through the application twice, and between each time helped to show them how to improve, while critiquing them in an uplifting an encouraging way, which allowed all of them to perform better the second time through. This leadership, of guided helping, and inspiring confidence while teaching, was a great display that I was able to take from, and will hopefully employ some of those same tactics in the future. "
"One time in the warehouse, the warehouse manager brought everyone together and spoke to them about a huge Lowe’s order that had to be sent out that day. It was a very motivated teaching speech. "
One time that fits this question might have been when I helped organize interns to work together in restarting specific settings on machines in the watt building. They were to report their results to our mentor and after they did their work I went back in the next day to check on all of the results. 
"One time that I encouraged people to discuss their different points of view was when I worked on the several small projects throughout the year. During this time I worked with several other people in the department to decide about pictures that would be posted or media projects that we would be collaborating on. Throughout these projects, I encouraged the other members to discuss any problems that they had with my decisions and told them that I was willing to change any decisions if the group felt it was best. The teams were often very appreciative of my willingness to work with them and contributed more than they would have if I had not respected their thoughts. "
"One time when I worked with a research project w/ people from other domain. Because of that, each person has their own point of view based on their domain. As a result, we used to have some meaningless discussion as everybody wants to sell their points. I realized one way to resolve this issue is to decouple the project into different level, from high level to low level, from one domain module to another. We first need to get agreement on high level direction questions, it might be general but answers the question where we go. Then for the detailed implementation, as we cut into different modules -- each module will encourage people in this domain to take a lead of the discussion, other people will review it. Through this way, we make meaningful progress and make sure we all on the right track."

"One time, we had a weekly group meeting in the Attribute team as usual via skype. Everyone talked about their undergoing projects and issues they are facing with for advices, suggestions or improvement. There was one point I thought it could be done in other ways to fasten the computing process. I show what I did before as an example and discussed the advantages and disadvantages for their information. The team members were interested in my idea and would love to try and compare the performance. "
One wellness activity I taught was SMART goals. I explained what they were and we brainstormed what our personal SMART goals were and shared our vision with each other to keep each other accountable. They all had similar goals and we discussed how we could help each other meet them.
Open discussions and communication often took place during the profiling project so that we could improve the process and make it more efficient.
Organized and led CI students to accomplish Clemson Aquaponics objectives
Organizing student help during National Scholars Weekend. I had to make sure current Scholars were available and willing to assist with logistical aspects of the weekend. 
Organizing students to help with NSP weekend and serving as a point of contact between students and NSP staff. 
"Our boss does a good job of trying to rally everyone to keep people encouraged in increasing bookings, social media presence, and service. "
"Our classes are Diabetes Self Management Support Groups and so we always encourage ideas, struggles, and achievements in our sessions. This promotes unity and infiltrates a group dynamic as people share common goals and struggles. Many times we ask what may be causing set backs in achieving their aims or what is allowing them to be more successful. These discussions, prompted by our questions, allow the participants to open up and use the group as an asset in regards to their common disease."
Our event took place right after the big hurricane hit in the month of October and I encouraged discussion about if the event should be postponed or if other means of communication was necessary in order to get all information necessary for the event to take place. 
Our HERDS director took charge of the projects and sent us in the right direction. 
"Our lab is very collaborative, with members from a diverse set of fields. Because of that, we are often given tasks best suited to our skills. For me, this was normally programming, circuits, and micro-controllers. Utilizing our best skills, we were able to build the best prototype we could as quickly as we could. "
"Our largest event for the year is the Donor Appreciation Event. I helped in coordinating and setting up the event. But, I also had to act as a leader by giving people jobs to accomplish so that the event could run smoothly. "
"Our managers for each engagement were great examples of leadership. Whenever we were at a site they were constantly checking up to see where each employee was at with their tasks, and often offered to help or give guidance in order to stay on track with the deadline. I learned that a good leader not only need to supervise and or direct to achieve the goal, but also be ready and willing to step in and help if their assistance is needed. Being hands on in a supportive way is a great quality of leadership. "
Our Marketing Director had weekly meetings with us as a team to make sure that all of us are on top of our assignments and consistently asks for feedback about what else she can do to help us and what else Tigers Squared can improve on as a whole.
Our mentor always values hearing new and different ideas. He encourages people to share their views and is flexible enough to change the approach. He trusts individuals strengths and help them to grow their skills and talents.
Our mentor appreciated and respected that I was a nutrition major and the other intern was a psychology major. This was helpful in counseling for phone calls. She always found ways to relate to both of our career interests. 
"Our mentor had given us a series of tasks to complete, and after initial communication, we went off to complete these tasks. As a team we were able to solve many of the questions we had, and when we were finished, we were able to hear from our mentor what else was needed. "
"Our mentor Lydia Forster an environment of excellence and continued development. She managed both myself and a marketing intern on top of her already demanding job, and leads us towards providing excellent service of Clemson transportation programs. She's a managerial idol and someone I would model future managerial styling after. "
"Our mentor throughout this internship was a masters student. I and my fellow intern co-worker were guided by this student with more experience than us. He helped us bring our ideas together to form one coherent project with dual aspects. He helped better collaborate with each other and helped us better understand what we needed to do to complete a research study. There was one instance where we needed to analyze samples on a machine that neither I not the other intern had ever ran. Our mentor helped set us up with an expert in the lab that taught us all how to run the machine. Then our mentor proceeded to help us with analyzing the samples on the machine, so that we could complete our project."
"Our mentor, Chris Paredis is very understanding towards every situation. He always respects every decision made as a team and provides a logical way to handle every situation. He recognized the skills of every individual and assigned roles accordingly."
"Our mentor, Mark, assigns projects based on the needs of the building and our own capabilities, giving seniors more complicated projects like using an AI to track the number of people in a room, to giving me the task of using monitoring software to create a power schedule for the building."
"Our mentors, Dr. David White and Tim Howard assigned each member of our team a role to fulfill based on our skills. Each member of our team filled their roles very well and our mentors very accurately gauged our strengths and skills. "
Our office has weekly meeting to review the week's achievements and set goals for the following week. During these meeting my mentor allows myself and the other intern to present and discuss our ideas for ways to promote the office and gain more clients. 
"Our storage unit (cage) was full with different products. It was my responsibility to take care of the cage and report to the supervisor (Director of Engineer) if its not in good shape. After a few months I observed that the cage was full, and I didn't have space to put anymore products. I brought this to my Supervisor's attention. He alerted all the project engineers to mark every product that's no longer need as 'trash' in the cage. He setup an hour long meeting with everyone (7 Project engineers and myself). We were able to clean the cage and organize everything under his supervision. "
Our supervisor Chris Paredis' method of interaction which enables his subordinates and the occurrence of this time and again should suffice.
"Our supervisor gave each of us clear projects to work on that took into account the strength of each team member, for example I focused on social media, while another intern focused on creating graphics, while another intern managed communicating with other departments. At the same time our supervisor gave us opportunities for cross-training which allowed us to broaden our skill sets, for example having me work on learning Adobe programs for creating content and graphics."
Our supervisor Robbie is always super encouraging to everyone around us. He does an incredible job recognizing people's strengths and encouraging them to pursue what he knows they are good at. He also encourages everyone to learn new skills as well even it doesn't always turn out as planned. Each person on the team brings something different to the table and he knows how to have us work in the best way possible and also learn at the same time.
Our supervisor used monthly safety meetings to create awareness regarding our organization’s backing policy. People didn’t take backing were seriously. Our supervisor would demonstrate the importance of no backing by giving examples of industrial backing accidents. This helped everyone understand the gravity of the policy and work together to minimize the backing in everyday work. 
"Our team has weekly meetings where everyone comes together to discuss the progress their subsystem teams are making and what we need to do to move the project forward. One meeting was a bit hectic, with many students trying to interrupt and talk over one another. After the meeting myself and a couple other team members spoke about the dysfunction and how we could make things better next time. Next meeting, we were able to keep people respectful of other team members' thoughts and opinions by encouraging people to speak one at a time, and the meeting ran a lot smoother than the week before."
"Our team is very well-organized. Each person has their own focus, but we all use the same standard and guidelines to make design. For example, we have a design style guide website called “Kit” where listed all visual components our team members may refer to when we work on our individual projects. This makes sure our design is consistent across different projects. Also we have lunch and learn session every month, so that we could learn some skills together."
Our team leader organizes meetings very well every day.
Our weekly team meetings were always a wonderful time for everyone to brainstorm together about upcoming events or even tasks that needed to be completed around the office. Everyone's ideas were always heard and truly taken into consideration during these meetings.
"Out at HERDS, one of the interns was the director while the rest of us were assistant directors. During one of our Sunday meetings, the director sat down with us and had a new task that needed to be completed. This task involved coming up with a list of certifications that students in our creative inquiry could get trained in. Our director assigned us the different certifications topics in a strategic manner based on our major. For example, one of the interns was a mechanical engineering major so they got the topic pertaining to machinery. I got a construction topic because my major pertains to this. Our director was using our strengths to get the job done. "
"Out of all the 4 interns in my department, my supervisor delegated different tasks to each of us based on our experience and interests so that the work could be completed effectively and consistently throughout the semester. "
"Over spring break, I was able to sit and interview two Haitian fish farmers regarding what I and the rest of the organization may be able to do to help expand production in the Central Plateau of Haiti. This helped remind just how important CEDC's mission is to improve the quality of life of people in the Central Platuea. "
"Over the course of my internship I was able to analyze results on an issue that was ongoing, provide a hypothesis and lead some experiments in order to ascertain the root cause of the issue. "
"Over the past few years, Campus Recreation has seen a good bit of change. Most of this change was facility related, staff related, or policy related. This year is the first year of a ""fresh crop"" of employees. Meaning that the majority of student staff working here have been here for no more than a year. This summer was about correcting everything and ensuring that all staff areas were on the same page. This involved me having to work with staff members across the facility to put our ideas together and figure out a solution that worked for everyone and bettered Campus Recreation in the process. "
"Part of being an intern at the makerspace includes searching for issues to problems within the space and determining ways to resolve or improve conditions. An example of this was when I recognised that spools on the 3d printers were often becoming entangled about themselves, causing prints to fail. Thus I lead the research and development of new spool holders that were optimised to prevent the entanglement and be easily inserted into the current shelf frame system."
"Part of my job involves helping the graduate students in my department. While helping one graduate student harvest, I constantly asked questions about the process and why we were doing each process. As we worked, I realized that it might help to make some changes and when I suggested them, he agreed that they would increase the speed and efficiency in which we harvested."
"Part of my role is to signal to drivers how many guests in ECVs they have going to the park. This is to aid the drivers during the loading process, because the ECVs are loaded before standing guests and the drivers need to be prepared to do so. Midway through my program, greeters would try to signal to drivers that they had no ECVs to load by shaking their heads, or signaling zero, and drivers would misunderstand that signal as them having no guests so they would drive right by the load zone, without loading the standing guests. I got many of my coworkers together to discuss the problem we were having and then approached our leaders. While our leaders were unable to give us a clear answer, we were then able to approach various drivers with the problem to find a solution that worked best for us and them, and then immediately make that change in our load zones. Now, we wait for drivers to ask if the ECV is going with them and we are then able to signal by shaking our heads. Now we have less driver/greeter miscommunication and fewer guests left behind."
Participated in discussions regarding the marketing strategies that the Bulls Sox Academy could use.
"PEER/Wise is dedicated to retaining and providing resources for minorities and women who are in the STEM field at Clemson Unviersity. My supervisors oversees a group of PEER mentors in which they do everything in their power to help them achieve their goals and to also retain them at Clemson, all while promoting events and group opportunities to surround themselves around others trying to achieve their ultimate goal in becoming engineers. "
"Per the request of one of our board members, I was given the task to investigate and ultimately create a member directory. The need to continue our goal of being a tight knit community of learners despite our ever expanding membership base became an area of evaluation. We determined that an online member directory was a great way for our members to stay connected. Based on this part of our mission statement, I developed a report for our board of advisors that explained how a member directory would benefit OLLI, improve the effectiveness of our mission statement, and provided solutions to creating a member directory with all the features we desired."

"Peyton and Alyssa were other interns, but they took the lead on the intern project and lead everyone. They facilitated outside meetings and tasks. They split up the work to different departments and encouraged us to work together. They made sure to keep everyone on track and engaged."
Plate making is an important step in the pre-press process. Each individual on our team has different methods to succeed in plate making. As I continue to perfect my process of making plates I have gleaned numerous tips from each team member to ensure that I can be proficient and dependable when assigned this task. I actually enjoy making plates with knowledge that each one has a high value of cost to our company.

"Prior to the Spring Jubilee Festival, we realized that the construction in downtown Pendleton would cause a change in our usual booth locations. Many returning artists were frustrated with this change, but I was able to converse with some and change their perspective into a positive one. The construction would result in a very beneficial change for Pendleton and help us in the future."
"Prior to the Voice of the customer survey that I was able to create, I gathered my team along with my fellow interns to a brainstorming session to discuss the issues we are facing using the products. I gave each and every individual to express their point of view on the subject and was able to achieve a common goal."
Provided feedback to Committee Members from a student perspective 
"r. Throughout my internship, there were multiple opportunities for group discussion during meetings with the GIS team or just working in collaboration with my fellow interns. I think one important characteristic for someone who believes that have qualities of being a leader, is encouraging others around you to criticize you or your work. Frequently my mentor would criticize my work or ideas in a constructive way of course, but just as frequently, I would encourage my fellow intern to take a look at my program or map and constructively criticize them in the most honest way possible. The discussions we had over our work very frequently led us to positive results, which was especially crucial when we were working towards the same goal on a joint project. "
"Recently, project management has rolled out a new strategy that includes having teams document their projects in a more rigorous way. Teams that have been around for a longer time were not incredibly receptive, so it took constant encouragement to convince them that these methods would lead them to their immediate goals more quickly, and that ultimately the goal of their project, to create a low cost water testing unit that remotely communicates data, has global implications. "
"Rick is over the 4-H shooting sports in SC, so he is always developing and leading new groups of kids. He encourages them to shoot the best they can and he becomes their friends. He becomes someone they can trust. Kids love Rick and look up to him everywhere. He believes in the kids and he tell them that. He makes sure to tell them to never stop working hard though. Rick truly wants to see all the kids succeed, and I one day hope to share that same vision for my own group of 4-H kids I am leading."

"Scrum is a project management methodology used in Software Engineering. We have a bi-weekly Scrum meeting wherein each team-member shares openly what projects that have worked on in the preceding two weeks, where they are at with their projects, and what issues are “blocking” their progress. These meetings are conducted by my UPIC Mentor, Sam Hoover."

"See answer above. Also, one of my purposes of creating this program is to overcome the obstacles that women face in today's society. It is often viewed negatively if a woman is stronger or more muscular than a man. Being a competitive powerlifter, I experience this regularly but have learned to overcome it. Many women will never push themselves physically in the weight room because of the negative sterotypes, they are afraid people will judge them, or they do not want to enter the gym because of myths people have told them about women working out. In my program, I taught women how to properly strength train, how to deal with people discriminating against you in a male-dominated environment, that there is no reason why you can't be one of the strongest people in the gym, and that time/persistance/hard work will get you anywhere you want to go."

"Since all of my mentees were Computer Science students, I held a meeting where they all were to sit and discuss with each other, what they expected from each other, and how they can help each other succeed this semester. I also asked them how I could be an aid in this. Because of this encouragement, my mentees were really close, and communicated with each other to help each other with their classes. "
"Since I am graduating, I knew it was crucial to prepare my team to take over this project for next year. I started by making sure each of them had the same level of responsibility as I did and that we all had equal communication with our client. I constantly reassured the members that their youth didn't mean they weren't valuable members of the team and that their input was welcome. "
"Since I am the only one working on my project (besides my mentor, who is assisting me), my capabilities (and limitations) are what ultimately influence the future direction of the project."
Since I have been here the longest interns were always coming to me for questions or advice
"Since I have worked on this farm a long time and have had the experience already I feel I have expert leadership skills. This skills defiantly came in handy when I had to train the new summer workers on how things are done on the farm, how to complete a certain task and how to work the equipment on the farm. "
"Since I was an intern and there were employee who were doing somewhat same things that I used to do (analyze packaging), one of my mentor asked me to share my work with them and take their views on same. This is the time where I felt that instead of sharing(email) I should meet with them and communicate face to face as this will allow me to make them understand my work better which eventually will help us in achieving same goal in better way."
"Since I was an intern in my company, I never got to lead a team in a high professional level. But, during the annual picnic of the company, I was leading the volleyball team which was formed by my work team members. I was considering the fact that everyone should play and always stay positive and learn from the mistakes everyone including myself was making during the game. There were situations where we were behind the match and everyone had different point of view for catching the score. I always encouraged the team to get together in time-outs to quickly share points and conclude a mutual strategy. We ended up to the final of the matches which was pretty satisfying."
"Since I was just an intern, I don't really have a big stage to show my leadership. I tried my best to connect with each other and show my leadership. For example, when my colleagues sometimes cannot finish his works since he had too many to deal with. I helped him to finish that part of the works. "
Since I was one of the returning interns at the office I was given more responsibilities than I have in the past. I was also asked to plan more events such as meetings for all the interns. Being one of the senior interns some of the newer interns looked to me when they had questions. 
"Since I was the only man in the office, I took charge of the guys during PWE as their mentor. Since they could relate to me better, Mrs. Lisa would sort of communicate to them through me to keep them as part of the group."
"Since I worked independently with only my site mentor I had very few opportunities to empower others in the workspace. However, I had to take the led on all of my projects which I believe makes up for the lack of human interaction. "
"Since I'm working solo on this project there are not a lot of opportunities for me to work and interact with others. Therefore, leadership has not necessarily been a main focus throughout this semester."
"Since my team is very small with my mentor, manager and myself I haven't had a real opportunity to work with a group etc. "
"Since my work my not a typical group project, I did not have the chance to lead the team. However, I took the lead in planning deadlines for myself to make sure work was completed in time. This quality I learnt by observing my mentor"
"Since our product is biodiesel, I suggested adding a Life Cycle Assessment to the research to verify is the method we are using is more efficient, environmentally friendly, and cost effective than other methods of making biodiesel. The results of this LCA could potentially be useful for companies that want to create valuable products from waste streams, as well as good for the environment!"
"Since the stated goal of the Watt Center was to provide a collaborative space for people to work on projects. To this end, I took the time to both contact groups that could use the technology in the building and inform other students about features of the building."
"Since there were multiple interns at my site, my supervisor would give us projects based off of our skills and interests. Some of the guys were former baseball players, so they were given more baseball-centric projects. As a business major, I was mainly in charge of the projects relating to marketing and other business functions. Dividing up responsibility kept all projects flowing in a timely manner."
"Since we have different sections of our department, I took the place as the spokesperson during our weekly meetings. I took all of the information that I was given from the other student employees and managers, and I was able to make sure that their concerns and questions were presented in the meeting. "

Social media calendar and all the help that came with it
"Some defective parts were sent back to the plant from the customer. My supervisor put together a team to analyze the parts, to determine the reason for failure in the parts. The team worked over time and for a few days with various people taking turns to help with the task at hand to get to the cause of the problem and ensure that no defective parts are sent out."
"Some groups that come into the video studio ask for more creative advice on how to structure their video or how to edit it to best achieve the goal of the assignment. I try not to directly give them answers, but I instead find out their ideas and what they already want to do. From there, I'll advise them based on what they want to accomplish and recommend looking up similar videos for inspiration. I feel like encouraging discussion and getting them to talk about their ideas helped them more than simply telling them what they should do."
Sometimes there would be requests made that weren't exactly achievable. It was a team effort to communicate what was within our abilities to produce given the time constraint. 
"Steven always made sure to assign us tasks he thought we had the necessary skills to complete. Also, when choosing teams for the group projects, he took into account everyones strengths and weaknesses and how we could help each other. "

"Team meetings every Tuesday and Thursday. It was during these discussions we made sure everyone spoke up about the problems they faced in the project, and everyone was encouraged to speak up on any potential solution ideas to resolve it."
"Team meetings originally were chaotic in nature because of an unorganized effort towards coming to a collective decision. Realizing that not all meetings are to be had to get a conclusion but to get different points of view on the table and further analyze the situation, was a major revelation. After that, ensuring that every relevant person with respect to the topic puts forward their point was of utmost importance. The same was ensured thereafter and improvement was observed with every meeting."
"Tell me about a time during your internship when you observed a supervisor or other employee recognize, respect, develop, and capitalize on the unique strengths of individuals from all backgrounds My project of developing an automated data pipeline needed the correct data to be collected and fed to the pipeline. My supervisor thus asked me to work in collaboration with the senior database developers to learn how to efficiently extract the data and also get acquainted of the most efficient methods to complete this task. My supervisor thus recognized the need for a collaborative approach to achieve high performance and this collaboration helped me and others in the team to respect and recognize each others expertise and learn from each other."
Thanks to my experience over the summer I have basic knowledge of the Watt Center's operations. I used this knowledge to help new interns learn some of the day-to-day tasks that are performed. Because I had recently been in the same situation I was able to answer questions they had and tell them important things I learned.
"The “It’s Not Too Late Campaign” is a great example of my effective leadership efforts. The shared vision was to promote studying abroad this summer by passing out snack with slogans to the student body. I was able to get the whole office behind me on this mission and get them involved to the point where they felt invested in the process as well. At our meeting, everyone was really excited about the project and wanted to voice their opinions and ideas as well. I was able to effectively get them to participate and empowered them through my updates on our successes along the way. Every time I would finish passing out the snacks, I would come back to the office with a new story about how much they meant to the students and the group really enjoyed hearing how their part of the projects transcended into this positive end result."

The 10 interns had to come up with a creative strategy for fundraising
The assistant manager of the farm was very passionate about teaching me and the others about proper equipment care and use as well as animal care and health. 
The best example of this is when we were having a somewhat slow day and so I challenged one of my colleagues to break his usual record sales for the week.
"The best exast example I have of this is creating the survey for the alumni banquet and newsletter and allowing students to select answers I hoped were holistic to the range of responses they could give. I also included a question that allowed students to suggest ideas to us about what they wanted not only for the alumni banquet but for the department as a whole. This semester I didn't have very many group meetings, most were one-on-one or me acting as a liaison between two different parties.mple I have of this is creating the survey for the alumni banquet and newsletter and allowing students to select answers I hoped were holistic to the range of responses they could give.

This information is going into the website I was beginning this semester and planned to develop more next semester. This semester I didn't have very many group meetings, most were one-on-one or me acting as a liaison between two different parties."
The Board of Directors meets often to discuss how we can work together to increase our impact and one of these ways is by communicating how we can reach more people
The Call My Name project was a very difficult project to get rolling at the beginning of the semester because they scope of what Dr. Thomas was hoping to accomplish was so wide. We had to work to narrow that scope and find specific direction and targetable goals to achieve by the end of the semester and build a roadmap for successive semesters. One such instance was setting up a meeting with Jeffrey Kallin over in Athletics to gain his insight on video and digital media so we could communicate Dr. Thomas' message through those mediums. There were a lot of moving parts for me to align in setting up the meeting and we left the structure of the meeting open to encourage brainstorming and idea generation and thinking within a very specific mindset.
The case for support I created forced me to align the programs and initiatives of our institute with those of the university and organize them in a compelling format to encourage alumni and community members to donate directly to our department.
The CI Decipher group did a great job cataloging the strengths and characteristics of CI members and writing about their areas of research.
"The conference center staff is pretty diverse, as far as personalities and strengths go. One of my supervisors always knows which employees to ask about which tasks because he knows what they're good at and what they're not good at and don't enjoy doing."
The cool part about my position is that I get to work with a lot of international students. This presents a lot of cool challenges because people communicate in different ways and you want to be able to present things to the postdocs in ways that they will fully understand. My boss has done an excellent job of exemplifying to me the best way to communicate with people that come from different backgrounds. She leads the postdoc community well and they all appreciate her greatly. She has done a good job as leader of showing her that she truly does care for their best interest. 
The day to day operations revolve around the shared goal of keeping all the systems up and running and providing stellar customer service.
"The Deep orange team had weekly meeting where we used to express ideas and the work which was done over the past week. During the first few weeks of the internship, body dimensions was one of the major targets and as the geometric integrator for the team I was responsible to hold discussions. Ideas and suggestions were taken from all the different subsytems like interiors etc. and feedback was given o them by me and our subsystem."
"The department manager once had a meeting with us intern. During that meeting, we have discussed with our works. And everyone on the meeting can provided some suggestion on what you have done and what you will done. The manage also provide some very good instructions on our research works."
"The department put on the Recyclemania competition at Clemson this year and also organized the Zero Waste Game in coordination with Recyclemania and I played a large role in organizing the events that went along with it. We had to meet with athletic leaders to figure out exactly what we would be allowed to do and when. It was very complicated to try to align two different organizations (Clemson Basketball and Recycling) who had two very different goals, but we managed to work together and produce a successful result. "
"The development of user personas was a great challenge as it requires a lot of inputs but certainly becomes chaotic if thirty odd people yell out their ideas. The team leads and project leads recognized the need to develop personas in smaller groups, but also the importance of members from all the sub-systems inorder to suggest features that these personas demand from the car."
"The director of my department does a great job of meeting with other department heads to get a clear understanding of what they want/expect when requesting a project from marketing, then presents us with a broad idea of how she thinks we should go about it, but then opens up the floor for anyone to chime in with any differing ideas they may have on their area of expertise"
"The director of the department that I work made it a point, both at the beginning of and throughout the semester, to meet with every mentor and ask them what they would like for the organization to look like. She didn't just do this for pretense, she actively listened and put in the work to help start on that path and eventually reach that goal. She was allowing us to have a hand in how the organization was shaped. "
"The employee recognition and reward program within Development is very developed and has been one of my favorite projects to work on throughout the duration of my time at the Development office. My mentor serves as the Director of Talent Management and Operations which includes our reward/incentive program that involves monthly recognition based on goal accomplishments and allows for a very supportive environment. She is also great at recognizing the strengths of others and respecting their interests, and she does a great job in assigning tasks that match both skill set and interest without limiting opportunities among four part-time interns at a time. "
The entire business was just me so I had to take the initiative for everything and motivate myself and lead myself.
"The entire structure of the study abroad office relies on specific supervisors assigning and entrusting tasks for their individual interns to complete. One unique example of this was between Dr. Wilson and Peyton this semester. Although Peyton was hired to be a general intern with very specific tasks initially, Dr. Wilson soon discovered that Peyton was very gifted in graphic design and marketing. She decided to utilize this skill set and put him in charge of our “its not too late” ad campaign. In a matter of days we were able to get this message, in addition to a well-made video from Peyton, out to thousands of students. Our numbers consequently spiked. This was a great example of a supervisor recognizing and utilizing the specific strengths of an individual. "
"The ERM department is very small, consisting of only myself, my boss, and my other fellow intern Antonio. Thus, our boss entrusted Antonio and I with a lot of responsibility and gave us the freedom to take our tasks in any direction in which we felt best. By not requiring a specific way of doing something, this required me to take initiative in my tasks and take the leadership to contact the appropriate people to explore all options to better our process. "
"The first thing I did when I was tasked with finding a way to monitor power in the Watt center is ask my fellow interns how they would go about solving this problem. I was given many different ideas, from placing a monitor onto the ground wire of the power strip, to using a modified raspberry pi computer, to using server-class power monitors. In the end I had settled on a plug-load monitor which was more expensive than we had preferred but would reliably accomplish this goal."
"The Global Awareness Film and Discussion Series events contained a discussion component at the end that I sometimes participated in. They encouraged film viewers to understand a situation from someone else's viewpoint, generally people of different identities."
"The goal of my internship is the design of an end-user device. The end-user is not trained in membrane science, which is the base of the technology around the device. Therefore, it is required to make the device as friendly to the user as possible. Sometimes this meant that the design had to be altered in such a way that the performance was lowered, but the less human error was possible. This led to multiple discussions between me, the client, and my supervisor, in which we tried to combine our knowledge in membrane science, the end-user, and manufacturing, to achieve the common goal of a device that was feasible and useful."
The goal was to relocate a gas pipe line without affecting the work of two different contractors and the tenants who used the gas line. I attended the meeting in which several potential solutions were presented by the different parties involved in such a way that all would benefit from it. 
"The greater part of my job is assisting and my mentees. I would often find my mentees asking me about different study tools, certain tips to help boost success within a class, advice on how to handle certain academic and social situations. For example, I had a mentee who was accused with cheating. He told me about the problem and I helped him see the situation through from start to finish. "
"The hackathon was not a project that my mentor assigned to me, but rather, a project that I came up with, developed into an idea, came together with a team of fellow students to define and bring about. In recognizing Clemson’s organizational goals of enhancing student learning through REAL engagement and learning, I was able to align those goals with my team’s goals of recruiting new talent and supporting the hacker culture at Clemson. By recognizing this opportunity and clearly communicating its value, I was able to convince my mentor that this was a valuable use of my time as a UPIC. The hackathon itself required the aligning of multiple groups’ interests—CUhackit, the Watt Center, the Clemson Makerspace, the Immersive Space, Student Affairs, Student Government and multiple corporate and Clemson sponsor such as Siemens and Clemson Mobile. Beyond raising $35k for the event, we were able to secure the entire Watt Center for the weekend for free and received hundreds of dollars worth of in-kind donations in the form of materials for the event. None of this would have been possible if multiple groups had not been aligned in their objectives and goals. "
"The HR of the owner (BART), for our (interns) benefits makes us maintain a weekly journal which describes all the work that we did in the entire week. This helps us creating systems that enable everyone to keep track of our goals and progress. This contributes to a sense of accountability around the goals that were set on the 1st day of our employment."
"The infusion preparation process was done in a manner that ended up in a gig in the transom and eventually needed a team member to go to next station and fix that gig. I dug into the root cause and trained the people working on that section to prevent the occurrence in the first place, thus achieving the common vision of Lean Manufacturing"
"The input of Power BI by me made the data analyzing and visualizing really easy and neat, and it encouraged the entire quality team to learn about it. and it also encouraged everyone to take the trial version to learn Power BI."
"The internship at the dairy is not really a group activity, its generally only two individuals running the parlor: one intern, one farm employee. That being said, the two full time guys who run the parlor have to work with all of the interns, needing to vary their timing and approach accordingly for each. "
The internship supervisor would always be aware of an interns capability. A lot of us come from different backgrounds and majors and have different levels of experience and skill and he knows how to designate a job for all of us.
"The machine shop manager is the highest form of leadership in the machine shop. I am constantly interfacing with Dr. Schweisinger to work out new ways to improve the machine shop. I then relay these policies and ideas to the rest of the team and collaborate to execute these items to improve the operation of the shop. Our goal is to operate like a top 20 machine shop in the USA, and we are constantly striving for that goal."
"The main example I have for this section deals with the vast amount of time and effort that went into editing, revising, and updating policies that were meant to help the staff remain efficient, safe, and adherent to the Joint Commission standards."
"The main example I have is when seeking advice/ideas from various people. Although this isn't me ""leading"" them persay, I had to learn how to take the initiative and reach out when I need help. This helped me facilitate discussions in which I learned about others' thought processes as well as adapted to others' points of views."
The majority of the time i was alone when classes came and visited so i had to lead a big group of people.
The majority of us that served as counselors at our large camp had never been a camp counselor before and my mentor helped guide us and teach us how to be with the kids and help make the cmap run as smoothly as possible
The managing director would come in the room often and help the recruiters with their client calls and candidates searches when needed and they would create individual incentives along with group ones with the company's and then within a few members of the same recruiting segment like all the accounting recruiters are on one team etc. He will provide support and suggestions as well when people would come up to him and ask for guidance on how to handle a client or prepare a candidate for an interview. 
The masters student who leads the Oconee Food Summit project often felt unsure of their actions and decisions. I have experience planning a Food Summit on Clemson's campus and empowered her to keep her course and be assertive in order to accomplish our mutual goal of realizing a successful event.
"The non-profit I interned for is a coalition that is made up of a bunch of different health organizations in the county. The coalition meets once or twice a month to talk about what their different projects are and how the other organizations in the coalition can support, help, or work together to make the projects better. Alyssa, my manager, is the executive director of Healthy Rowan so I sat in a lot of meetings where she could take two different organizations and their resources and help them work together to achieve a goal or provide a service for a population in need. "
The office was planning ways to recruit students for studying abroad in the summer and fall and I took part in meetings where new ideas were encouraged and thoughtfully considered. I responded as positively and thoughtfully as I could to others suggestions. 
The online employee evaluation system was an idea that my mentor wanted to implement. He gathered a group of us to collaborate and work towards achieving the idea he had in mind. He took leadership and guided us towards implementing the new system. 
The other intern and I constantly discuss work and projects. Our work is very design based so we are always asking for feedback and possible changes.
The other interns and I would communicate with problems we encountered and would pool our knowledge before asking others around us and at higher levels. 
The other interns in my office are very hard working so we are always encouraging one another. Working with my mentor she has asked for my input on specific projects and I have been able to assist her to share a common vision. 
"The partners encouraged us to always remember why we do what we do, even when the work is tedious, burdensome, and mind-numbing: our clients trust us to prepare their returns accurately, legally, and in a way that maximizes their tax savings."
"The PEER/WISE Office regularly puts on Wednesday night leadership development series. I attended one about studying abroad. The information was given to all of the mentees to come and some of them did. I was then able to add to that lecture and talk about my own experiences studying abroad. I aligned the objective of getting the ""study abroad experience"" out to the freshmen engineers by giving my personal experience along with the broader organization of the Study Abroad Office's presentation."
The Plant growth project required insights from team members from different backgrounds. I encouraged my seniors to have team meeting so that everyone could subject their opinion to the project which helped in picking up the pace of work.
The plant manger at my plant leads a team of supervisor from all departments. He conducts morning meetings to assess the performance and he acts a bridge between all departments. He listens to their input and gives a lot of value to the feedback of other team members. 
"The President of the Makerspace has been away this Summer at an internship in Seattle, so the responsibility fell onto me to lead the Makerspace in the right direction, as if the President had never left. Things like hiring practices, certain purchases, and creating tools for the next generation of interns to use."
"The Pro Benefits Expo is a complex event regarding multiple space reservations and a large amount of third-party vendors. My client, his boss, and another woman from the department were in charge of planning this event and requested me to assist in this process. At the meeting, I made sure to bring in other pools of knowledge such as the head of operations and my mentor. It was as if his team was just meeting for the first time and things were initially chaotic. I managed to step up to the plate and use my title as SEC to align everyone's visions and keep us focused on the main goal while keeping the group satisfied. The Pro Benefits Expo was a huge success, and the client along with his department has said that they will be working with us on all future events."
The project manager appreciated and recognized my effort while working on a job site issue and provided feasible solutions to overcome the obstacle. He let me present the solutions to the owners myself and helped me build confidence.
The projects that I worked on were completely independent projects so in context I was leading the projects all by myself and this taught many things at every stage of the project delivery.
The purpose of the LinkedIn account for the department was to be able to connect with ESED alumni as well as others interested in the goals of the department. I'm glad I was able to be a part of that. 
The Software that we made once failed at the midnight. I took the responsibility of the code that I had written and also analyzed to see that my fellow teammate whose code did not had problem. We both then together solved the issue and we solved it better that we got an appreciation form the higher management on making a very nice validation software application.
The Sr. Quality Manager to whom I reported inspired me by his style of addressing people and issues. He always stayed focus and delegates work accordingly. 
"The student employees at Campus Recreation is a diverse group. Haley Cox and Ben Blodgett has always recognized students who have worked hard and those who were willing to help by providing REC Points. REC Points are worth/ equal to $5. Once a month, students can use their points to buy Clemson merchandise."
The supervisor of my project has been quite encouraging in fostering discussion between different members. He asked the students to regularly ask questions about the progress even if the field didn't lie in the area of expertise. That's why he also regularly scheduled 1-on-1 to provide feedback.
"The supervisors for this internship were extremely helpful when it came to answering questions and aiding our development in using the data sorting programs. They were also easy to communicate with, and showed that they cared about our professional growth."
"The transition into this internship is likely one of the most difficult life transitions you can make. Words cannot explain how difficult it is to enter a completely new culture with no English, extreme poverty, strange (to us) practices, and a whole new diet. I cannot imagine having to go through the process on my own, and for that reason I am EXTREMELY grateful for the excellent leadership displayed by my fellow intern, Lillian Hardaway. She had already been in country for a full seven months so, by the time that the new cohort arrived, she was a seasoned professional of the Haitian culture. We nicknamed her ""the mother intern"" and truly, she was like our mother. Every question we had and every situation we were unsure of, we went to her and she always knew how to handle it. "
"The university intern project involved working with public relations, writing, photography, and creative interns. AS lead video intern I had to attend all the meetings and communicate what our team could contribute to the project. "
"The Vice president of Operations displayed excellent leadership skills in dealing with an internal issue within the company. He understood everyone's opinions, stood neutral and motivated them to focus on growth and to impose positive culture within ourselves. He understood the unique aspects of every staff in his company and focused on their strengths rather than pointing out mistakes to solve the problem. "
"The virtual reality immersive space itself is a part of two different organizations, the virtual reality club, which is student operated, and the CCIT Virtualization Lab, which is operated by university faculty. As a member of the former and an employee of the later, it was my responsibility to work to fulfill the goals of both organizations, whether it be in providing assistance and access to the space's technology, or working to recruit additional members to our space's club through our normal hours of operation."
"The woman above my boss held a conference called the Autism Awareness Workshop where she brought in professionals from many different areas that dealt with Autism like occupational therapists, speech pathologists, psychiatrists, and pediatricians to speak about their work with Autism. She was able to recognize the strengths of people from different work backgrounds and bring them together through a common interest. "
"The work I did in promoting study abroad opportunities for STEM majors and the RiSE community helped make it possible for these students to go abroad. Through information and drop-in sessions I helped RiSE students find programs that could work for their majors and advised them on how to go about the study abroad process. Some of them then planned to study abroad in the summer or in future semesters at Clemson. I worked closely with Yuki, my mentor, to make these sessions happen and discussed my accomplishments with these students with her weekly."
There are many instances where my boss and his boss have to come together to figure out how to execute a certain program and discuss which solution would be the most user friendly.
There are often a lot of meetings that occur within the many divisions of the program and grant that my mentors have to be involved in. I was able to partake in a diabetes prevention meeting with one of my mentors Melissa Bales and another person under our grant who was working on efficiently maximizing our ability to transfer data from online program to program as well as other time-management strategies. In this meeting I was asked questions about what most of my time is spent on and how I believe the system and the way we do things could be more efficient. I was a contributor to the team as we worked towards finding ways to make our days run smoother. 
"There had been a bug in some software displaying weather data on one of the lobby displays. When Mark asked if any interns knew certain programming languages, another intern stepped to the plate and took on the task. Mark recognized their skillset and capitalized on it to help fix the weather functionality. "
"There had been an everlasting problem of gear measurement frequency at the company I work at. I created a solution to the problem, presented it with the engineers and decided to lead the project."
"There have been many times that I have had to take charge in the shop. For example, during strike (when we clean up a show) it was my responsibility to remain in the shop while my mentor worked on stage. I had to oversee multiple works and direct them in taking apart pieces, cleaning up debris, putting away pieces, and organizing tools and parts. I had to actively discuss with the workers what they "
"There is a strong diversity in the maintenance department. Every engineer working belongs to a different background and educational experience. Thus, it is very essential to understand each and everyone's strength and weaknesses during the functioning. Once, the team had to bring out an entire die for rebuild. The tasks were planned and executed by specified technicians in proper order to finish the work within the given time. There, no matter how small the work was, every worker was given due respect for their work. Each and everyone working were a critical part of the maintenance procedure and hence, there must be a strong bonding between them."
There is still alot of things that I need to learn about leadership because it is not something that comes naturally. But through collaborating and communicating with my peers I have become more confident in my abilities to lead people.
"There isn't many opportunities to delegate work but as far as showing leadership skills, each intern is required to lead in their respective areas."
"There was a day when the company had to achieve the common goal of meeting with all the scheduled clients, but it was too much for a normal work day. I suggested that we delegate and split up, with me doing the duties that I could perform on my own without the vet's direct guidance. We got everything done in the day with time to spare."
"There was a lot of creative freedom, but I never had the opportunity to teach someone under me how to do what I was doing because there was no one under me. If there was, I think I would have performed well."
"There was a problem with people taking chairs from the creative lounge and the interns having no place to sit at the table. I was a part of the discussion to suggest several different approaches to solving this problem. In the end, we got a sign that has the studio hours on it and a reserved seating message."
"There was a Renovation team formed by my secondary mentor Moustafa (Head of Renovations) which consists of 2 interns including me, a business development guy and him. I was in the team because of my Estimation and Attention to detail skills, one guy is taken for his management skills, the business guy to bring more jobs and Moustafa to supervise and make feasible and final decisions in the best interest of the team. He tried to cover every basis required for this purpose and given us certain responsibilities to handle and perform them diligently."
"There was a time during my internship that we faced a time of hardship when we were vandalized and had significant property damage. During this time, tensions ran high and there was a rush to solve the issues we faced and catch the culprit. Everyone had different opinions of how it happened and how to contact the authorities to fix it, but the bottom line showed that the damage had been done and needed to be repaired. This situation showed me that during employment, there were going to be external hardships that influenced the way that day to day operations were run. In order to facilitate helpful discussion and to solve the issues, I listened to everyone’s opinions and allowed them to speak their mind, while I turned to day to day operations and repair so they would not worry about the menial issues. While my supervisors were involved in conversation and the following investigation, they did not have to worry about the day to day tasks and were able to solve the crime with my help."
There was another intern who worked on different days than me. I stayed in contact with her to ensure that we were on the same page and being efficient and consistent in our work.
There was another intern working alongside me throughout the duration and often times we were assigned to the same project. If we were not on the same page it was very difficult to complete a task so it was vital that we worked together to achieve a common goal.
There was leadership practice everyday at the studio because of the constant teaching that had to happen. Helping groups with thier project and working through a variety of problems made me use leadership skills constantly. 
There was multiple times that we had a job that we needed to be completed to I would gather information from everyone so that the method we used to complete the job was the most effective way.
"There was one day when all of us interns and our mentors went up to 4th floor WATT and we had to trace every electrical wire to it's correct box. This lead us to form a team in which we all had a job that we lead. Someone plugged in and tested the boxes, someone flipped the switches to see which ones worked, and someone wrote down the information. "
There was one new employee that started mid summer and he was very good at driving a skid steer. Every day a supervisor put him on one and he was the main guy to work it.
There was one project where the deadline to get the project out was very quick and people needed to work extra hours so that we could finish in time. On the day that the project was due there were about 8 people that had to stay later and work together to finish. I had been working on the project the entire week before and knew a lot about which drawings we needed and which ones that we did not need. I ended up being the person that everyone was asking questions to and I had to give out work to certain people to do so that we could be more efficient. The project ended up going out on time and the client was happy to see that it had been done within the short time frame.
"There was one time where each of us interns were discussing what our current projects were, and what we were doing to achieve them. At this meeting, we were able to provide feedback to the other interns as we saw fit in order to understand if the project's goals were being met along with whether the project was being completed in the most efficient way possible. "
There was this one time when I was in a meeting with my manager and an operator from one of the process lines came into the room with a potential plan to reduce a non-value added task. My manager was all-ears for the conversation between the two and appreciated the operator's idea. Later my manager wrote down a mail indicating the idea of the operator for opinions from the other managers. This helped me paint a picture for a work environment that encourages and respects employees from all backgrounds to pitch in suggestions. 
There wasn't much room for leadership in the internship as I worked alone. Examples may include my supervisor speaking with new students and answering their concerns differently depending on their specific needs.
"there wasn't really an opportunity to ""lead"" however I was the most senior in the photography position"
There were a few times where a certain Cybersecurity article or topic would initiate a conversation about ethics or future outcomes. We would discuss our viewpoints and usually come to an agreement or a settlement over what technology is ideal/realistic. 
"There were many different tasks in the office that required a fool proof procedure. When entering surveys or mailing out individual packages to the different counties, it took thought and insight from everyone involved to create a process that would make my work as efficient as possible. I took it upon my self to collaborate with others around me and make decisions on what would work best for me and others working on the task. "
There were several times in completing a project where Paige and I would bounce ideas off of each other to come to a conclusion on how to organize for an event or how to display a flyer. Another intern that Paige works with would also work with us sometimes on the organizational aspect of projects.
"There were some steps in the protocol that I disagreed with, so I led a discussion with my mentor and fellow interns about how it may be made better, and those steps were put into place."
There were two activities where I was in charge of leading a group of volunteers in clean-up events and environmental improvement. The first event was a pond restoration at the Anderson Civic Center and the second event was a stream clean up where I was in charge of 13 kids age 11-17 in an effort to restore a stream off of 28 by-pass in Anderson SC. 
"these events have yet to take place, however, they are guaranteed. I am the only intern from my organization that was asked to return for next semester. I noticed that the student in charge of us what having trouble expressing in detail what exactly he wished the other interns would improve on. I offered my help as best i could to share my opinion politely this semester. These efforts were appreciated and I am currently in discussion with the head of the Immersive Space to help train the next group of interns on their expected daily conduct while on the job."
"They are designing a storage rack in here, the quality manger had some concerns with the first concept, so they had to redone it. for the 2nd prototype review, the quality manger did not show up for some reason. We had to make a quick decision. I used my previous knowledge about quality and the concerns they had about these racks to lead the team to do some testing and make suggestions for improvements. I took pictures of what we suggested and showed it to the quality manger later on, and he approved it. "
"This answer is very similar to my last answer. I had to step up to the task and take on a lot more roles this semester as the health educator who ran DPP quit at the end of last semester. I was able to collaborate with our whole team to figure out when we could do make-up sessions, when to meet to discuss the collaboration between the programs, as well as update the team on what was going on with the DPP program at our monthly team meetings. I also had to lead make-up sessions with participants. In addition, there was a new intern at our site this semester who I was tasked with training about all of the various intern responsibilities at my site. "
This goes along with collaboration: I would also lead development projects due to being the most knowledgable with the system and had a few projects that I spearheaded or led.
"This happened during a department meeting. My supervisor, gave the opportunity to the engineer to lead a particular project, as a recognition to the hard work he had done to collect all the background information."
This happens during the discussions between my supervisor and I on our research project.
This intern did not give me a commanding role as a leader. Decisions were not based on me and hence leading a team was never an option.
This internship has not required me to take on any leadership roles because I am simply working underneath my one boss. I do not have anybody working underneath or with me that is necessary to lead. 
"This is a difficult one because I did not necessarily hear anything supervisors or employees would say to each other since it was all technical Spanish, Catalan, or very fast and mumbled. The only thing I really noticed was when I would finish a project or update a group on what I was doing and they,d say, ""Good. Keep going"" or something like that."
"This is a general answer, but every project that was assigned to me was completely given to me. My mentors didn't need to stay on email chains or check in every step of the way because they fully trusted my responsibility and leadership capabilities. "
This is displayed weekly as my Mentor leads meetings for the PEER Mentors. In these meetings we discuss how our mentees are doing and learn academic and life strategies to pass along to them.
"This is practiced all of the time in my internship position. My UPIC is largely related to event coordinating and preparing. In order to achieve our goals for each event in a proper manner, my UPIC mentor meets with me and the other UPIC intern and explains everything that needs to happen for each individual event and tells us what we need to do in order for the whole to work together to achieve success. "
"This is similar to my answer to question 23. Anytime we would meet with stakeholders our overall goal was to help everyone see directly where on the process they fit in, and how others contributed to the success of the overall process. In this way we not only allowed the stakeholders to own the process themselves but also be aware and acknowledge the contributions of all the members of the process as a whole."
This is similar to the project I worked on with the table saw. I took the initiative and ran through the testing procedure with multiple departments. 
"This is the first semester that this Spotted skunk project has utilized the UPIC program, so leadership was needed to help with a smooth integration. There were initial issues with payroll, but Laura Gigliotti was able to step up, solve the problem, and keep me informed on changes as they happened."
"This job is all about leadership and finding a form of leadership that works best for your team. For me, that form of leadership is ripped right from ""The leadership challenge"" by Kouzues and Posner; Find a common goal. In my world of special events, we all always want the same thing, for the event to be successful and for the client to be happy (and at the end, to hurry up and go to bed). I think the best example I have for this from the semester would be the Paint Party that CLEMSONLiVE puts on every August for the new freshmen. Campus Activities and Events is in charge of running that event, and for providing things such as a crowd barricade and generators for the DJ's equipment. Unfortunately for me, I only had 1 staff member who was crowd control trained, so it was me, him, and my old director of operations setting up a rather heavy barricade. The adversity and leadership came in when it was 1:30 in the morning, and we were still trying to pick up these 200-300 pound, wet and slippery pieces of metal, and load them back into our truck. We all wanted one thing, to be in bed, so in order to make sure we all met that goal before sunrise, I essentially opened the floor to any and all suggestions to get to get the barricade back into the truck. Finally, after many ideas had been tossed around, we found a solution that worked and made it to bed before 3:00. "
"This job makes us be leaders because you have to take that role when teaching someone. Also since I have some experience at the adobe center, I help those who are newer to the space and guide them when they need assistance. "
"This position taught me a lot about what a true manager should look like. I had to be tough on some people, even though I didn't want to. I also learned how to correctly motivate people in order to see them succeed."
"This pretty much happened anytime I assist a photographer on a shoot. As a photographer, especially on campus, you have to work as a team to capture the right photograph. This often times involved taking on leadership roles to achieve the appropriate end goal."
"This question almost relates to every single project I worked on during this Summer. Being a graphic design job there are some things easily overlooked when you are designing for hours and hours on end. Every employee in the Football Recruiting department is apart of a group chat where we can send ideas and receive constructive feedback for wording, color schemes, or simply misspelling. Having an extra set of eyes to review a project always proves beneficial, especially at the level that these graphics mean for the university."
"This question does not apply to my internship, but a time that my supervisor did develop a team was during the hiring process. All the employees met at the beginning of the semester and we all had one common goal, to make the dairy farm more efficient. "
"This semester a group of mentors volunteered with Habitat for Humanity. Our project involved laying down sod for a morning. In order to make this more efficient, I encouraged the group to work together and form an assembly line in order to get the work done as quickly as possible. In doing this, a task that usually takes the entire morning (8am to 12pm) ended up only taking 2.5 hours (8am to 1030am)."
"This semester I had the pleasure of training my replacement for this position. During this process, I took the approach to let her learn while doing. I wanted her to be hands on so that she was not overly stressed when I was not there. I would give her an event and run through it with her but then she would finish it from start to finish. "
"This semester I have had to become a stronger leader with other student employees. When necessary, I must train Hub staff to prepare daily Money Drops so that we will have proper documentation and strong evidence if there were ever an issue. On occasion I have needed to take corrective action if a Hub Staff member is incorrectly preparing documentation of payments."
This semester I have noticed the Finance department in Campus Life working with all the Student Event Coordinators to help us with invoicing and help understand the process more. This helps us grow in our confidence when doing invoicing.The also lead us to streamline our invoicing process. This helped us learn what part of invoicing we were best at and capitalize on that. 
This semester I have observed my supervisor utilize different people from unique backgrounds in order to help her evaluate candidates in a hiring process for a position that became vacant in December. She has coordinated schedules of different people across varying departments so that they could all be there to give her their opinions about who the best candidate should be. 
This semester I have really had to step up to be a leader as I am the oldest person here and I have been here for the longest. This semester I have had to train new SEC's for them to take over while balancing school and my job well. 
"This semester I led a group to plan a manager appreciation lunch. It was interesting to watch everything unfold, everyone though this was a good idea but had never shared the idea. "
This semester I mostly had to work by myself. This is because when developing software it is best to have one developer working on the project.
"This semester I was able to lead study abroad 101 sessions, and I loved doing so. I was able to share my unique experience of studying abroad in a non-traditional location and hopefully encourage students to branch out in the locations where they're looking to study abroad. I think my mentor was also very excited for me to lead these sessions for the same reason I was, and noticed my excitement for taking on this new task. Throughout the semester, all of the interns and mentors would meet as a group. At this time, we would catch everyone up on our individual progress, and our mentors would inform us on how we were progressing with our overall goal. We would also discuss possible marketing ideas for how to get more students to go abroad to further reach our goal. Everyone would contribute ideas that they had, and we would discuss how we would make that idea work. At the end of the meeting we would have reached a decision on how we should promote studying abroad. "
This semester I was appointed head intern for my event so I was able to work with a number of other interns. This level of responsibility helped me to gain valuable leadership skills and improve upon the skills that I already had. I was responsible for delegating tasks and this including making sure each intern was given a task that best suited their strengths and making sure things were done on time. 
This semester my boss took on a student feature video for a student who is deaf and conveyed her story beautifully. It was amazing to see her overcome challenges and be a role model for other students.
This semester my bosses really let me take responsibility is teaching and helping out the newest intern with anything she had questions about. This was a great way for me to step into a leadership role.
"This semester my supervisor asked me to do a talk on the recycling options we have for events, in the hope to move toward a more sustainable presence on campus. During this talk I explained our options on campus, off campus, and pricing options. Being able to contribute in this way is awesome, as sustainability is something I'm very passionate about. "
"This semester since I have not been focusing on training our new interns but rather doing research, I have had the opportunity to really watch my manager. She assigns tasks and make suggestions based on what she knows about each of the interns but also challenges them so they have the opportunity to grow and learn something new."
"This semester was a lot of personally led projects. This involved a lot of self leadership, when I was at the Greenbuild conference I had to take the initiative to talk with experts about my project. I had to make them interested in my project in order to talk to me about it."
This semester was unique in that it was the first regular semester with the new police chief. That brought its benefits and challenges. A lot of what we do at student patrol is changing towards meeting broader campus safety objectives. Chief Mullen is actively working to expand our role and change our perception on campus by adding new positions and programs. This requires a lot of leadership on my part in order to make sure all of our positions are working together effectively and aware of what the immediate and overarching goals are. 
This semester we are training two new SEC's so I have been able to help train them both in our procedures and policies. 
This semester we have primary worked as a team to get assignments done but I am my own leader in ensuring I hold up my weight on tasks. 
"This semester we launched our “It’s Not Too Late” initiative and I spear-headed the campaign by bringing the vision to our group and getting input on how to best achieve it. We decided on handing out flyers, extending drop-in hours, and using our networks to get other organizations involved. Everyone was very engaged in the ideas and excited about making it happen. My leadership definitely aided in the effectiveness of this campaign and I am proud of all the success that my coworkers achieved. "
This semester we were required to give training sessions. On of my peers was not very happy about this. Another peer and myself gave him the opportunity to express his concerns to us but still encouraged him to give it his best effort. 
"This semester, CEDC implemented a new project life cycle that would create deliverables for every stage of the research, design, and implementation processes. My fellow interns and I were tasked with doing back end evaluation of the new guidelines and determined that it detracted from the progress of many groups. From this determination, a new group within the organization will be formed that takes some of the research burden off of many groups. "
"This semester, I had the opportunity to lead groups of students in exploring Clemson and various engineering disciplines. Through SEE Clemson I gave prospective students and their parents tours of campus and sat on a panel for the students to ask questions about Clemson. For both Girl Scouts Day and STEM day I was the leader of a group of students and led them around campus and to the various engineering activities that were planned for them."
"This semester, I took complete control over the career center's blog, Crafting Your Clemson Career. I delegated content creation to undergrad career ambassadors and had to communicate the blog's vision and mission to the ambassadors so they understood their responsibility as writers. "
"This semester, my main priority was to create a training program for future medical scribes that the Sullivan Center hires. I completed a program that had 8 modules for various educational areas that were required for obtaining an adequate understanding of the roles and responsibilities of a scribe. Additionally, I worked on creating templates within out electronic health record system for various illnesses so that the documentation process could be more thorough and standardized throughout the clinic. Therefore, I was a source that the center utilized for their providers to achieve their vision of having a uniform electronic healthcare system to improve efficiency and patient care. "
"This semester, the new intern Jennifer came in with much more histology experience than me. Rhonda recognized this and made her the primary employee to do sectioning and staining of tissues, which helped with quite a few imaging projects."
"This semester, we had two new instruments brought in to our facility. I was able to watch my supervisor lead and supervise a range of different people during this time. He had to lead the delivery people, those actually installing the instruments, and then those of us who had to learn how to operate it. He also gave a presentation to colleagues from different departments on the instruments and their importance to our facility. "
"This story is the same as the one that I had for communication. But essentially, we realized that the way that we were doing something caused a lot of problems and concerns that we hadn't realized previously. Because of the issues that came up, I brought it up to our group during a staff meeting and asked for ideas or options or comments about the way we did it currently and how we could fix it. After coming up with ideas, we found a solution that will make the situation go much smoother and is more fair to the students in a way that it wasn't before."
This was also something I experienced when working on the intern project. I often found myself asking the other interns questions and they would ask me some as well so that we could all come up with a common plan for the project. Our meetings were a space where everyone could share their opinions without judgement.
This was during a time when we had discussion with the art school. Although we did not like their concepts our team leader was able to communicate our concerns to the designers without hurting their feelings. 
"This was during the 5S audit in the plant. There was a template to be prepared for the audits. Many people gave their opinion regarding what to include and what not. I gave my support to one idea which I felt to be impressive and my inputs were considered. in the end, my inputs were used as a feedback and changes were made accordingly. "
"This whole summer has been like this I feel like. We talked to so many sponsors who wanted to help with the show, board members who helped with the show, and volunteers who wanted to help with the show. Therefore, I worked at pointing them in the right direction, and keeping the show kids their first thought while making decisions. We also had to communicate the success of the show to everyone every step of the way, so it's been a lot of leadership."
This year for Give Day I decided to help explain to some of my friends why they should considering giving to Clemson and hopefully continue giving to Clemson for years to come no matter the amount!
"Thought my entire internship Dylan and I had to communicate efficiently because we were working side by side on the same project but weren't necessarily in the office at the exact same time. I created google docs to combine our research and interviewing materials and any other materials we gathered throughout the process. We also work on collaboration during phone calls with Mr. Parsons, both participating and ""interviewing"" Mr. Parsons. Also I was given the opportunity to be the leader and present our work from the entire semester to the Board of Directors for the Spiro Institute."
"Through delegating tasks and creating new marketing strategies for Campus Banner and Design, I took on positions of leadership and accountability. It was my job to make sure that clients were being communicated with and that our services proved to satisfy their needs. I left a summary of the work I did for the next intern to look at for reference, hoping that my projects will grow and improve."
"Through facilitation of collaborative work on project proposals for the lunchbox gardens, nutrition and culture sheets for sweet potatoes we grew, and development of branding and signage. "
Through my internship I show great leadership skills. I am the oldest internship in the office in terms of experience so I am able to help out other interns with any questions. I also have showed leadership through trying to complete my hours with a severe injury. I feel all the interns at the office create and accomplish a shared vision because we all have different projects we work on and communicate with each other on those projects so we can help out the office as a whole. 
"Through my internship, I got to see my mentor develop his presentation to present to his colleagues to convince them that service learning is an effective way to teach."
"Through my internship, not only do I work with Clemson Campus Recreation, but also with the non-profit organization Smart Fit Girls. The program was started here but since the co-founders have moved to the west coast therefore my mentor and bi-weekly Skype meetings were the sources of support I had with my internship. Because of this, I have to be very independent and jump into the leadership role and not only a UPIC intern but also the head coach and coordinator of an after school program supported by a non-profit. Through my leadership role, I had to act as the liaison between the co-founders on the west coast who wanted to make sure I was implementing this program correctly, the school and school coaches who also used much of the resources we did such as the weight room and gym, Fike recreation center and my mentor who participated and assisted in any way she could, the coaches that I recruited who assisted me in implementing this program and with the girls who were going through this program and participating twice a week in our lessons and activities. "
"Through the UPIC program and because of my schedule, I was able to attend the Adobe workshop and receive training on design and the tools Adobe has to offer. Unfortunately, my coworkers either did not have schedules that allowed attendance or did not have the opportunity to go. I was able to share what I learned with them and open a sharing platform for ideas and questions regarding design and advertising as it relates to our department. This was just a small part of projects that we may do every day. "
"Through the webinar which I participated in, relating to the Bilingual Employee Program, I was able to foster productive discussion relating to ethics, duties, and roles within the healthcare setting. I was able to effectively discuss the difference and responsibilities between that of a bilingual employee and that of a healthcare interpreter, which helped in significantly improving my communication and leaderships skills."
"Through this experience, I was able to serve as a leader to these students by connecting them to other organizations which I felt that would get them the best connected to Clemson. A couple of these orgs included CUSG, A bevy, and fike. "
Through this internship I have developed advanced leadership skills. Consistently within the graphics office there is continuous shared visions and open communication. Positive and negative criticism is an important part of being a designer and this internship helped with these skills.
Through this internship I think that I have gained a lot of confidence when giving others advice about what it takes to run a business at this age. I have given presentations to other college students through Dr. Hannons courses where I have gotten lots of feedback about how inspirational it is.
"Throughout my internship experience, I had met so many individuals on campus. It is one of my favorite parts of the job! I love finding ways to connect with these individuals in the future. It might be a simple hello on campus for some but I am excited to say that I have met with a few of these interviewees for outside volunteer trips. "
"Throughout my internship experience, I witnessed my coworker, Raine, lead excursions. The excursion groups would develop once she created the trips and gave members the opportunity to sign up. She then would lead these groups to museums, hiking trips, or even to a play. Each trip she lead the group to their destination and whether the objective was to learn or simply observe, she lead them to these goals. Julie also was a leader when she developed and led a group to Tanzania, Africa at the beginning of my internship. On this trip she led the group towards their goals of learning about the culture, sightseeing, and exploring. "
"Throughout my internship, I have been making sure the flow of information between all the groups involved has been steady, respectful, and informational. With every project I've been involved in, I have been working on either a bioadhesive that ultimately may have a wide variety of medical applications as well as helping a small start-up get and grant to allow their company to get off the ground. "
"Throughout my internship, I have worked to discuss projects to make sure that I am prepared to help film to the best of my ability. This involves discussing the idea and feel behind our projects and what will best visually represent that."
"Throughout my internship, I strived to make connections with each in the office and get an understanding for what they were working on. I found it necessary for each of us to be able to provide help or advice in the instances that another needed it. When someone was struggling with a solution, I would aim to gather opinions, and therefore a solution."
"Throughout my internship, I was responsible for engaging the rest of the Directors of CEDC. This included coordinating efforts between the Current Operations, Internal Communications, and Marketing Directors in order to insure the success of various events. Each of these groups works towards unique goals, but ultimately each group is working in a way that will ultimately allow CEDC to function and communicate more fluidly. My role as Program Director required facilitating communication between these three groups to make sure that although Current Operations is responsible for logistics of trips and events; internal communications is responsible for organizing correspondence between directors and groups and between the organization as a whole; Marketing is responsible for communicating CEDC to community, that all three of these groups realize that ultimately they are working together to allow CEDC to work most efficiently. "
"Throughout my internship, I worked alongside another intern. There were areas that she was stronger in such as using InDesign to create graphics. But, there were areas that I was stronger in such as using Premiere Pro to create slideshows. I would take leadership in showing her how to do the things I was stronger in and encouraging her to master the program herself. We were then able to present any problems we ran into, as well as successes with our mentor."
"Throughout my internship, individuals would come to me with their information and deadlines and I would create marketing activities based on these specific needs. While the departments are different, they have one thing in common: representing campus recreation in a positive, uplifting light. This broad organizational objective was necessary in creating consistent, accurate Campus Recreation branding. "
"Throughout my Value Propositioning project, I was able to lead department heads in conversations and discussions about the value that comes from each department's roles, which in the end contributed to the common goal of growth in OOBE. These different points of view all contributed to the development of the OOBE Goal. "
"Throughout my work with bibliotherapy, I have worked alongside MedEx in the training of MedEx students to become bibliotherapists. We have worked together on the training, the act of bibliotherapy, and in preparation for a bibliotherapy celebration at the end of the summer. I have been given tasks and told, ""you're in charge"". With that, I know that successful completion of the task is up to me, so I have to ensure that efficient communication will lead to success. This has mainly been done through email- emailing my goals to ensure that the project is successfully completed and that all participants and stakeholders are up to date with current and significant information. "
"Throughout the internship, I would ask my other interns some political questions that were relevant to when we were talking about them. I personally have a passion for having freedom of speech and expression, so I think asking those questions to my other interns was a way of promoting that, and promoting the sharing of ideas with one another. "
"Throughout the project, I kept communicating with my supervisor and other colleagues in the group to make sure we are on the same page and have the same understanding of the current progress and the future goals. While the direction of research is mostly originated from me, I listened to everybody's suggestions and input very carefully. With the group's effort, we were very efficient in the whole process."
"Throughout the semester as I designed our new brochure, I communicated with other interns to help complete the brochure and communicate with Rhonda to ensure that everything we needed was in the broc"
Throughout the semester I encouraged and kept track of the other writers articles that they wrote.
"Throughout the semester I have had the privilege of observing my supervisor, Rob Atkinson, lead our group of design interns to the goals we set at the beginning of the term. For me and many others this was to improve our design skills, get real world design experience, and create real jobs that satisfy both the client and the designer. Rob has done an excellent job of creating an environment where we all have the opportunity to reach these goals, and having a hand in developing those goals and skills among our group."
Throughout the semester we got to meet with different entrepreneur alumni that Dr. Hannon brought in. This was very interesting and was something that helped me understand what success really was in the business world through many different lenses and industries.
"Throughout the semester work was being done to the 4th floor. Me and another teammate, one day, had to help make sure the electrical connections were properly labeled. This required communicating and being attentive to detail."
"Throughout the semester, all of the interns and mentors would meet as a group. At this time, we would catch everyone up on our individual progress, and our mentors would inform us on how we were progressing with our overall goal. We would also discuss possible marketing ideas for how to get more students to go abroad to further reach our goal. Everyone would contribute ideas that they had, and we would discuss how we would make that idea work. At the end of the meeting we would have reached a decision on how we should promote studying abroad. Some of our previous ideas included a percent night at Groucho’s and hanging and handing out flyers for our “It’s Not Too Late” Campaign. "
"Throughout the semester, I have been able to observe my supervisor. One major time that stands out to me regard this question is Beta Gamma Sigma. My advisor, myself, the other intern for my advisor, and few other people involved in the College of Business organized and set up everything prior to the event. My supervisor, Allie, did a terrific job of explaining her visions for the event and leading us to ensure that the event ran smoothly. "
"throughout the various timber cruises, we have worked on, when presented with a problem from other interns I would ask them how they would solve it with the information they have learned in class. "
"Throughout this internship at Healthy Campus, I constantly maintained positive relationships with all members of staff. I showed respect to everyone in my office and the students that we interacted with on campus. I appreciated that we were all from different backgrounds and I felt that my acceptance of that really helped facilitate dialogue in various meetings such as the TATT board meetings and the Student Veteran's Commission meetings. "
"Throughout this semester I have been working with the IAC to coordinate energy audits and get companies on our page with saving money, and energy. "
"Throughout this whole internship, I noticed many of the employees in SAPub or in CB+D, really value each other and mention how much each employee is important for the whole process to work. "
"Throughout working on different projects, I liked to ask people to test what I had worked on to see if it was comprehendible "
"To better understand our strengths, my supervisor gave us the same technical task and gave us as much time as we needed to do what we deemed an acceptable job. Then, she looked at each of our work closely to determine who will perform best when time is limited and we have a real job on-press. "
To come up with the factors that affected our material selection for body structure we had discussion among the BIW team.
"To help me further understand why we were performing a test and what the data represents, my supervisor had the grad students who were studying in that area explain to me the reasoning. Which helped out a lot."
Today I got one of my co-workers to agree to participate in a fundraising idea that I created. 
"Today the main director took the decision to organize the office In two sub-offices: I noticed that he organized the two groups giving to each one person with the experience in documents and boards, one for design and renders, and a supervisor. I found it very clever because in this way we are trying to increase the speed of the works, reduce waste of times, better use each employee abilities and crate smaller groups with easier way to communicate and exchange knowledge."
Took lead and responsibility over suppliers and any non-conformance. This lead to faster solutions in an organized manner
"Toward the end of this semester we delivered a mobile aquaponics system to Erskin College in Due West, SC. This system was to be used by the college, and to also educate the middle school robotics team as they research ways of developing an automated aquaponics system. With that said, after we installed the system I was fortunate to be able to visit project leaders at Erskin. We had a great conversation about aquaponics and its place in the South Carolina Agriculture. Everyone was open to sharing their ideas and view points and once again they were asking me questions, which I guess would place me in some sort of leadership position. "
"Towards the end of my internship, our office was getting new carpet. The days leading up to this were very hectic; people were trying to do their work, but we also had to get everything moved out. The key to this was that everything had to be labeled and organized so that we could move in immediately after to resume operations, as we had guests coming to stay with us that weekend. Because the other members of my team had time sensitive work, I took it upon myself to help them organize files, belongings, and any other work I could aid them with. This helped free them up so that they could aid our customers and we could continue to have impeccable customer service. I am very detailed and thorough, so I was able to help organize who's stuff went where. After our carpet was installed, we were able to resume operations smoothly, and everyone's belongings were accounted for. "
Towards the end of our Internship. the team's goal was to have a shared platform for simulating our autonomous vehicle and integrate control with other subsystems. I initially had the idea to build a communication bridge between our autonomous and vehicle ADAS simulators. this led to a shared vision of how the autonomous capabilities would be developed. This was finally presented to stakeholders as a viable platform for developing the vehicle.
Trey my supervisor got three of us to do testing on peaches and he should us all how to do a part to make it efficient as possible and we were able to do it really fast. 
Trey told me to do some peach splitting with these girls and so I guess he lead us to a goal.
Trina and others initiated a sip and paint for our program so that the other students can have a decompressing event.
"Tullen has been an interesting supervisor to work with, as he does a lot with Creative Inquiry. It was interesting to see the way that he manages his team of Decipher writers and handles their needs as well as mine. (Decipher and I share an office space.)"
Two big events were held in the company and my supervisor and I developed a plan to share our goal and tried to achieve it
"Two coworkers were arguing over how to lay sod, and I told them to both share how we should do it and then I tried to make a compromise from those two opinions to make everyone happy"
Two of the interns had different opinions on an upcoming event. I was the middle man and provided a space where they would give the pros and cons of each ideas. I reminded them that they both shared a common vision and to not creep away from that. 
"Two other interns and myself were working on a project that was taking a while, and I just told everyone to push through because it would be worth it. We turned the project in and each said that we all worked equally as hard."
"Under my first supervisor, Destiny, the division of labor was highly tailored to everyone's strengths and weaknesses. At the beginning of Senate meetings, there are a lot of moving parts to make sure everything goes smoothly. Attendance must be taken from behind (no view of Senator's nametags), guest must be identified and prepared for announcements at the beginning of the session, refreshments must be set-up, name cards distributed. Destiny was brilliant at parsing these tasks to the person who excelled at each part."
Understood basic ideas about what all engineers do and then started attending meeting with all of them and learning/analyzing what is going on.
"Upon conclusion of our annual microscopy competition, we had a discussion of what we did and did not like. As the summer intern, I was responsible for getting all of the information together to launch the competition. Likewise, during the fall, our entire group worked as a team to effectively carry out this competition. I developed a document and a post event survey for our mentor so that we could go over what worked and what could be improved on for the next year. "
"Upon midterm presentations, all of the interns talk together and provide feedback/ask questions to figure out what everyone else is working on. This is a great way to have informative discussions and really just be able to learn and push everyone else. After one of the interns presentations, myself and another intern were able to ask Connor about his business process so that we would be able to help in to improve. "
"Upon the completion of trial, Shane led 3 lab assistants – including myself – towards completing the ultrasonic process of aniloxes for the upcoming trial. His leadership coupled with our group’s hard work led to completion of the task in a timely and effective manner. "
urged the other interns to get work done in a timely manner
Using slack to collaborate on projects and tickets
"Very early in our office, I notice our graphic design intern, who had worked for Tigers Squared previously, take initiative in helping people acsess different accounts and help them get familiar with things around the office."
"Very similar to what I described above in the first meeting I had with a Risk Area, we met with that same Risk Area, but this time, the major of the Risk Owners were present at the meeting. We wanted to get their feedback on the dashboards because they would, ultimately, be the ones using the tool we have created. Also, every one of them had a different perspective on the dashboards. For example, one would really enjoy the scatter plots, while another enjoyed a simple bar graph. It allowed us to take into consideration all of their opinions and produce the best dashboard we could for them. "
"Was able to provide useful input on the development of the research year in review document, and also was able to make good progress on potential publication "
Was the point person on major projects and had to respectfully lead my team.
"Watching Dil work in the lab with the other grad students as shown me a lot about leadership. She wants us all to succeed, however she does do the work for us. She encourages us with questions to lead us in another way of approaching the topic or how to improve our range of literature for research. "
Watching my mentor Faith lead the kids from camp to take samples from a water source and study it to find macroinvertebrates. 
"We adopted a new project management tool this semester, BaseCamp, I served as the initial tester of the tool and encouraged other interns to fully embrace it to report on projects. This ultimately helped our boss have a better understanding of our accomplishments. "
"We all know that we each have our own strengths and weaknesses. We all take initiative to listen to patron's problems, especially the ones we don't know how to solve, so we can learn more. "
"we all want to be the most efficient, especially with the animals. We all work towards a common goal, and that making sure all animals are meeting daily needs, well and producing efficiently. "
We all worked together to help B with the big ideas series and help Sierra with the three day startup.
We always like to see different sides of each problem. There were many times where I brought in my own prospective to a risk or a way something could be handled. 
We analyzed the results from different people and did a open discussion on these results. And we successfully figured out the right way to solve the issues in our fabrication processes.
"we are a team of software engineer's, physicists, mechanical engineers and computer scientists working together towards a common goal of developing advanced robotic radiosurgery solutions. Each Individuals skills are well identified by the supervisor and are properly guided towards fulfilling individual responsibilities."
"We are all assigned various projects, and I would encourage others and myself to proofread each others works. "
We are assigned tasks in audits based on what we are good at and occasionally push us into when we could do more
"We are in the process of establishing a satellite office at the CU ICAR campus, and I've been tasked with drafting the new policies surrounding satellite office work/employee expectations and presenting the project process timeline to the Associate VP. I also may have to draft a memo to distribute to the entire division with that information. The stakeholders are the employees, and I have to determine how to clearly communicate the progress to them. "
"We are on the process of implementing the new warranty systems analysis software. So, we split up the work evenly between us coordinating things, thereby Making sure there is continuous improvement in the software package."
We consistently held meetings with all the interns in University Relations to ensure that all viewpoints were shared in an open forum. My co-lead and I would present ideas and but also empower all the other interns to share their thoughts and give honest feedback to the group as a whole and us as leaders. 
"We did a very large project involving about a week and a half of work. One of the things I had envisioned for the project was complete organization. After kind of explaining the method to the group and the benefit, everyone saw the need for us to be methodical in the way we completed the project."
We discussed with our mentor different types of materials that might be best to use to get the job done. 
We do a lot of work for and with the social media interns. They present us with topics and events that they would like to advertise and then together we come up with the ideas. When we were introduced to the idea of doing some kind of founder's day video I encouraged us all to work together to develop some kind of unique idea. Something other than a recap video and something interactive. 
We encourage others to take on new projects on campus and hopefully off-campus in the near future and just being all hands on deck for my team member and mentor. 
"We faced a major failure mode which was getting worse with increased time of product usage which pointed to a design issue. I got the data which proved this and we had a meeting with all stakeholders like design, supplier, manufacturing where each of them could express their points for a design change and how each suggestion could help in ease of manufacturing with the changed design."
We frequently meet with many professionals and leaders. There was a critical meeting with the director of Laurens County half way through the semester. Many points were given on our side and on his side and with one in particular we spoke on the lack of collaboration from the emergency operations manager in Laurens. Each person in the meeting had their time to speak and each fulfilled a leadership role for the areas they were in the meeting to present. 
We gathered our entire lab team and everyone talked about their ideas to improve the lab.
We had a company meeting where the CEO has shared his vision with all the employees and motivated on how to reach the targets.

We had a discussion regarding the allotment of storage systems when a part is eligible to be put in both Automated storage and retrieval system and Dematic multi shuttle. This discussion brought about different ideas from different employees and we finally agreed on taking the average daily usage of the part as a key factor in alloting storage systems.
"We had a lot of team meetings and discussion so everyone could check-in and be on the same page of the project. Whenever we had different opinions, my supervisor would always ask someone in the team and ask about their thoughts, for example, ""Alex, you are probably the one with the most knowledge in codes, do you think it's viable that we can have two loading docks here?"" And then Alex can weigh in his ideas. Also, my supervisor always remembers other's achievement and enthusiasm. Once, I helped another team for just one day to make a concept model. Next time in the team meeting, my supervisor thanked me in front of everyone for helping the other team. I really appreciate his thoughtful consideration."
We had a meeting to discuss fixing up the UPIC page and we all had different ideas on what to do
We had a situation where we had to implement a material movement schedule for the AGV and the forklifts that supplied parts to the respective workstations. All the people from the logistics and the warehouse came up with ideas that were beneficial in discussions and meeting. I came up with an innovative plan where I not only reduced the headcount of the forklifts moving around but also provided them with the exact quantity of the parts to be supplied at the workstations every hour thus streamlining the production schedule in an even better way.
We had a wonderful group of leaders on my internship. They knew exactly how to talk to us to help us improve.
"We had an overall intern project for streamlined communication to early admitted students and I used my research to allow other interns to brainstorm ideas and the most effective ways to market to early admitted students. This included how to engage them into our social media, how to enhance our website, different platforms of communication, and what kind of content they wanted to see."
We had luncheons that I prepared and shared ideas during 
We had monthly ambassador meetings where a group of us within Campus Recreation would meet and share ideas with one another on how we could better the department and what steps needed to be taken to do so.

We had several meetings this summer were we able to discuss our visions for this year. 
"We had several meetings to discuss what is the next step for the ReadingRecovery website. Everyone shared their ideas on how certain modules or payments should work. In return, everyone listened and expressed concerns if the other person's ideas did not seem complete."
"We had social media meetings every Monday morning at 10 am throughout the semester. In these meetings, we would all express what kinds of content we should create and post throughout the week. I regularly offered to write content and take on responsibility for the group. This allowed me to assume a leadership role in the group. "
"We had some very obvious problems in the way we our process was being performed. We had a discussion ( Me, Other full-time employees) about the potential ways we could speed up the way we were handling things and the solution did work out. ( The information is kinda vague because I don't know if I am allowed to name anything.)"
"We had team meetings every week where we had to provide updates and future plans for each and every subsystem. So, during those meetings, I would often ask other subsystem members to provide feedback on our work. It was a great exercise as it helped us to understand things from multiple perspectives. Apart from that, even during subsystem meetings, I would often encourage my teammates to come up with new ideas and appreciate them for their contribution."
We had weekly meetings where different team members would present new findings and discussed problems.
"We have a lot of groups come in to use both the video and audio studios, and if they have questions, they will come to the interns. I have helped groups on multiple occasions where the individual students will need help reaching a common goal or completing a task that they had planned. Each student in the group will recognize what they can do to help, whether it’s in dealing with equipment or in the production aspect."
"We have a total of ten interns/grad students, plus a large faculty at Baruch everyone has been given the chance to become their own leader. Since all of our projects differ a lot in fields, they are all science related. Therefore we can all relate to each others projects and give feedback to each other, however we were all leaders for our specific fields."
"We have an impact project that every student intern has to participate in to better the team as a whole. I noticed not many people with special needs were attending the game so my boss and I worked on a sensory night so people with sensory needs could attend. This took everyone we had to achieve it, but unfortunately we could not fit it into the schedule this year. "
"We have an internal weekly meeting to discuss the progress of individual departments in the company. I suggested some ideas to improve the efficiency of the meeting as well as to incorporate the ideas from individual members, not just one leader of a department."
We have been working on rebranding and figuring out how we want to portray Clemson University. I also help out a new intern who has never been a photographer.

We have had to develop multiple social media contests for Campus Recreation. We all get together and talk about our different ideas for the contests.
We have meetings every week to discuss important things going on in and out of the makerspace. In there our staff gets to have open discussion and share their thoughts with the rest of the interns
We have meetings where we learn new skills together as interns with our mentors. We were doing portraits once and we were going over all the ideas and how to improve each other in certain aspects and it was fun. 
"We have monthly department meeting during the intern. In the meeting, the department supervisor first summaries about the accomplishments of the department in the previous month. Then, he encouraged people to comment on the department or other employee one by one, in a very friendly atmosphere. I feel the meeting went out very successfully. The supervisor knows how to encourage people when he is summarizing the accomplishments of the department. After the meeting, he also talk to someone individually, in order to get to know the people more deeply. He also tried to come up with suggestions or plans to help employees to become more successfully."
"We have one employee, Richard, who is highly efficient with the Hardinge CNC lathe. None of the other employees are very familiar with the machine. Therefore, as a leadership team, we encouraged Richard to write a training manual for the CNC lathe so that other people would be able to continue its use after he graduates this semester."
"We have stand ups twice a week in which we can share results, progress, or blocks. My manager can always give helpful suggestions when we have blocks and capture different views during discussion. She successfully leads the team to work on big projects."
"We have team meetings every few weeks in my department. We had to reschedule an event last minute. We all met in the conference room and Kelly took charge because she is usually the most organized. She capitalized on everyone's strengths such as her relationship with the Dean, Rachel's ability to schedule and her relationship with the people at the venue, Doug's relationship with donors and ""people person"" abilities, and the event was rescheduled with an invitation sent out the very next day."
We have to figure out how to do the next step. I will lead the discussion sometimes
We have to give each other help to complete the task that are big and which need multiple perspectives in the project.
"We helped get a political candidate on the ballot for a position. It was a lot of work, and a lot of it was boring. It seemed like it would never end, but I was responsible for reporting our progress back to the candidate and his campaign manager. "
we hired student ambassadors to work at the conference and we have a person on our team that will train those students on what they will be doing there
"We met with the CI team from the computer science department every Thursday. We planned to discuss the different ways that we perform narrative analysis at one of these meetings. Now, the CI team was made up of some incredibly intelligent people, they were fabulously smart and an all around pleasure to work with. However, they didn't have quite the same experience with narrative analysis; the hard sciences don't use it as much. I poured over the sample data that we would be discussing and evaluated it from each of their perspectives based on how each individual labeled the sample. When we met, I already had a good idea what there points were and I was prepared to answer some of their questions. I then asked questions of my own to try and encourage their own understanding of the material. Dan if, you're reading this, I made it pretty straightforward."
We often pulled strengths together in an office as well as resources to get the job done.
"We often work as a team to increase each other skills, since we all do things a little differently than everyone else does.
