"1 - Ability to learn new technology quickly 2 - Creativity!!! 3 - Dependable and ability to work independently Leadership, pleasant personality/warmth, and confidence in her work. "
"1) Daniel clearly has skills and knowledge that are well above average, with a strong work commitment, and self sufficiency, so he should take more leadership to encourage and share knowledge with other interns. He's only been here 3 months, but appears to be someone who could be an excellent leader among the other students. Develop that skill and help to bring others along. 2) Document work done, things tried, what failed, what worked, what the results were. 1) Seek out projects on his own2) Communicate better when calling out3) After trying on his own, it's ok to ask for help"
2nd year working for me and helped teach others
"A function of experience, I see her ""growing her voice"" in a collaborative setting - gaining confidence in trying new ideas and expressing her thoughts and opinions."
Aaron did not have many opportunities to demonstrate this.
Abby did not have the opportunity to demonstrate her leadership in our work. I'd like her to challenge herself to look for opportunities to gain practical experience in this realm.
Abby is incredibly well-rounded. Leadership is not a skill this internship afforded her an opportunity to practice.
"Abby joined the project as a UPIC intern after having participated one semester in the associated Creative Inquiry course. Without a parallel CI course this semester, she did not have the same opportunity to develop the leadership skills of managing an interdisciplinary team herself."
"Actually, it is very hard for me to say just a one quality - Meredith is an excellent student on all those qualities."
Adele is still trying to figure out what she wants to do.
Adrian could benefit from more opportunities to learn how to apply his strengths to lead others.
Ajinkya can take an active role and be a self-starter in projects which will help him develop as a leader.
Alex could use additional opportunity leading projects to gain this type of experience.
"Alex is smart and would be a good leader. I believe he's an introvert who has a lot to say once you get him started, but you have to get him talking."
"Alex prefers to work alone, so leading a team and delegating tasks is something he'll continue to grow in."
Alexis was able to work well with her group of mentees that were from a wide range of backgrounds. She recognized the individual strengths that each of her mentees had and was able to use this to advance the group as a whole.
"Allison has grown in leaps and bounds in confidence through working at the Studio. She is great at working with patrons to figure out their needs, and maintains a positive attitude throughout, both of which I consider essential aspects of leadership."
Ally could build upon her communication skills and translate this into furthering her leadership skills to capitalize upon the strengths of each of her mentees or fellow mentors.
Ally did not embrace opportunities to lead (although was always a valuable team member).
"Although Kasey wasn't put in a position to lead, her passive and quiet at times persona could be a risk."
"Although not an issue, more workplace experience would help with this."
"Although Owens leadership skills are good, he does not always delegate as much as he could. This is something we will be working on next semester."
"Although the opportunity was not available often during this internship, Nithinkumar could use more growth in running projects. I have this planned for him before the internship ends."
"Although the opportunity was not available often during this internship, Raj could use more growth in running projects. I have this planned for him before the internship ends."
"Although there isnt a strong ""need"" for improvement, Gouri strikes me as someone who has an innate leadership ability and I think with good grooming she could becomae a great leader."
Alyse has incredible leadership potential and I believe has the components to be a leader in her sphere of influence - she has a quiet demeanor and I think it will take time for her to see that potential and capitalize on it.
"Alyse is a silent, incredible leader - but she is quiet. I think if she were more extroverted and spoke up more, she would excel in leadership. She has all of the qualities of a great leader - I think giving her the ability to exercise that would be an opportunity of great improvement."
"Alyse is a very quiet young lady. She was an amazing asset to our team, but I would love to see her excel in leadership. She is so quick with thought and ideas, that she could potentially lead a team or group very well."
"Amy has been great with us, however she has only been working in our location for a few months. Many of her peers have years of experience doing what they do, so it can be tough for an intern to step in and become a leader among them. Amy has all the tools and abilities to do so, however there was definitely room for growth in this area."
Andrew has show growth potential in leadership
Andrew should utilize colleagues to generate ideas on how to further his project.
"Andrew worked almost exclusively with me, so he didn't have many opportunities to leverage the strengths of other team members."
Armoni is so used to having to rely only on herself to accomplish her goals that she sometimes has an expectation that others will fail to follow through.
"As a single co-op in our lab, William did not have much of an opportunity to demonstrate his leadership potential. His skills in this category may be excellent but he did not have a chance to demonstrate that."
"As a student intern, I think there is always room to grow with respect to leadership and ownership. Chandler is so awesome in every area, it is hard to pick an area for improvement. However, there are a couple of projects for next semester that I am going to let her take the lead on and look forward to seeing even greater growth in this area."
"As an intern and young in the professional career, I wouldn't expect leadership to be a strength. I believe with time and experience the leadership skills will come."
"As an intern, you are not frequently in a leadership position. There was not ample opportunity to demonstrate this trait."
"As chief editor it has been Stone's responsibility to lead group meetings, manage the teams' writing schedule and assign articles but he taken a backseat to other personalities in the group and relied on me for these."
"As Harshit progresses in his career, Leadership and team-building will be required to grow other team members and accelerate his personal growth. Harshit has not been in a position to demonstrate significant leadership during this term, but I'm confident he will contribute in those ways when given the opportunity."
"As mentioned above, Abele has not been in a position of leadership or managing a team. From her experience level and history, I would think that this is an area where she needs more exposure and thus training. In regard to the other fields, Abele is either competent or above average for her age and experience."
"As previously mentioned Alton has shown great leadership within the Makerspace. Additionally, I think he has the ability to become a great leader withing the Makerspace team."
"As she grows and matures, her skill in this area will undoubtedly increase because of how she carries herself and willingness to learn."
"As with Erin, Sam did not demonstrate any lacking in leadership, but it is probably just the least demonstrated within the role (which is probably my own fault in designing the internship)."
"Ashleigh could work on her leadership skills. She can be a leader, but can be overshadowed by others or others do not always follow along with her plans even if it is a good plan or idea."
Ashleigh is great at communication but could improve upon her leadership skills. What she does within the realm of communication could be expanded upon to further recognize and capitalize upon the strengths of those she is working with.
"Ashley is a very good leader, but there are times when others are not willing to do something. In those cases she is not sure how to motivate them to get involved. She will try other methods, but if she can not get them to get involved she will become frustrated."
"At his age, this is not a bad thing. This will come in time."
"At this stage of the internship, Leadership would be a difficult competency to demonstrate but needs to be an area of focus as Alvin progresses in his career."
"Audra, has shown great leadership in the general operation of the makerspace, however has not been given the opportunity to take a leadership role within the internship team. I believe she has the ability and would encourage her to grow in this further."
Azrin maintained a great relationship with his mentees throughout the entire year. He was often called upon to be a representative for PEER to talk about our organization and the services that we offer.
"Bailey brings a level a poise to the work she does that very few othere in her peer group could acheive. She takes charge of situations, she is self-directed and she finds ways to bring great things out of those she works with, even beyond what they thought was possible."
"Bailey is a growing leader, but still has ways to grow in her confidence and ability to step up and step out in taking on leadership roles."
"Bailey worked one part-time internship and her goals were to learn job skills needed to perform her job tasks. In one semester, she was not able to attain the experience needed to develop leadership skills."
"BECAUSE I DIDN'T ALLOW FOR ANY EXPOSURE FOR CHINMAY. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A BENEFIT BUT, THE SITUATION DIDN'T ALLOW"
"Because of not being an engineering major, Isabelle holds back some from taking a frontal role in our STEM programs. She is an excellent team player."
"Because of not having the engineering background, Hannah was somewhat hesitant to take the lead with our STEM programs. However, she was eager to be part of the team, always very helpful and was excellent in giving an insightful, different perspective."
Because she hasn't the opportunity to leader a team
"Becca is a great team player, but does not always step up and take the leadership role in areas where we know that she would excel."
"Being the newest member of the team, I did not expect this competency. But Sarah Grace can be reserved, so it will be interesting to see how this skill develops."
Ben has a demonstrated record of accomplishing tasks and keeping the shop running smoothly
"Ben's greatest area for improvement is in the category of leadership. As an intern, Ben had the opportunity to lead a team in a week long focus on workplace organization and ventilation. While he did a great job, it was apparent that, as with us all, further development in this area is necessary. He should work to understand other's strengths and weaknesses and apply the strengths in a way that advances the team towards its common goal."
"Bethany was not able to be in a position of leadership, so it was difficult to evaluate this characteristic. I'm sure she would thrive though in a leadership position if she were in one."
"Blaine exceeds all expectations in these fields. If i have to choose one with slight improvement it would be leadership. Though she leads well, assertiveness can sometimes lack. Confidence in decision would bring her to a cut above the rest."
Blaine is very proactive and shows great initiative at times. I would love to see her step up more into a leadership roll come spring to help support and train the new intern as her knowledge of this position has grown immensely.
"Blaine, has been with me for two years. Her greatest strengths would be all of the above. She has developed and learned this job over the years that I am able to lean on her when things get crazy. Blaine has the patience and where with all to assist and pick up in any event/situation. She has been a leader in helping to train the incoming UPIC intern and make sure they have all of the information they need to succeed."
"Bradley has already a very comprehensive set of advanced skills. Leveraging these skills and developing leadership will set him on a very successful career path. This is not to say that Bradley has a weakness in this area, but to emphasize his great potential."
"Brendan's role did not require leadership to be successful, but in the future Brendan could improve and be a leader to leverage others strengths to achieve a common goal."
"Bri is definitely able to identify others strengths and challenges, but she sometimes lacks the confidence to act on her instincts in helping others improve or encouraging them to tap into their strengths for future use."
"Brianna is young and does not have a lot of experience. But this will come. She is confident and articulate and with time and experience, people will follow."
Brittanie has not had multiple opportunities to grow her leadership skills and realizes that she needs to improve these skills.
Brittany is aware of task ans dutities assigned
Brooke has a strong personality and will mature into a great leader. Right now she is watching and establishing herself and the future leader she will become.
"By nature, LeeAnna is more quiet and reserved. As she matures in her career, I hope she will be more confident in herself and become a leader in her field!"
"By no means a weakness, Madison has been a good leader in helping the new interns learn the ropes. She is very quiet, but could be an amazing leader."
"Caleb has all of the skills to be a great leader but he doubts himself, in addition he needs to understand strategy, empathy for others, and how to use his thoughts to influence others."
Can be more assertive
"Cannot evaluate his leadership skills. Given all of his other positive traits, I have no doubt that he will become a strong leader."
"Carl did amazing during his internship and has a lot of leadership potential. I think the first couple months he was getting acquainted with everyone and finding out other strengths to leverage. I listed this as an area of improvement as I believe some things he was working on independently he could've asked for help sooner or leveraged others to be more effective. Regardless, he is a rockstar intern to have and i felt very comfortable having him practice leadership by dealing with other teams and managers directly."
CARMEN IS A NATURAL LEADER BUT SHE DID NOT HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXCEL IN OUR ORGANISATION. THIS IS SOMETHING SHE CAN ASPIRE TO LATER ON
"Caroline lead the team that produces the English department newsletter. Her group successfully completed 7 issues of the newsletter which required interviewing, editing, and producing around 30 articles."
Caroline's greatest area for improvement is leadership because she tends to wait for others to give her things to do and will take a backseat to others in a group project. I think leadership includes having initiative and that's something Caroline could improve on as well.
Carter lead the UPIC magazine project this year and successfully managed her team.
Cassarra was able to guide her mentees in a positive manner in their academics making sure that they used and applied all of their resources. She also kept her mentees engaged with other activities across campus.
Castles served as my right hand and delegated responsibilities to his peers. He showed managerial leadership even when spread thin between two research projects and many assignments I gave him.
Catherine has not had as much opportunity for leading tasks so we plan to work on that next semester.
"Catherine is always accepting of projects or tasks when asked, but I think she has room in grow in taking ownership of projects - identifying the next steps herself, noticing problems or issues, improving upon them, and bringing others into the project."
"Chandra was a critical resource on many of our projects, but he wasn't asked to lead projects. He could benefit from the opportunity to lead and drive a high impact project."
"Chandra's leadership and communication skills have grown during his many months here, but there is still room for improvement. He has taken a technical lead role, but he could benefit from the experience of leading a cross-functional project."
"Chanty is a great leader, but could continue to grow in her leadership skills as she finishes her senior year and approaches graduation. Being sure to pull on strengths of all people involved in her group."
"Chase does put a good foot forward, he is a driver and make things happen."
Chase needs to be more empathetic and understanding of his fellow team members and then how he needs to adjust his management style to address concerns.
"Cheng did lead his project, and has led others in its completion, so I wouldn't want him to think this is a weakness. However, I think there are opportunities to further develop his ability to communicate what he's doing, why it matters, and what he needs from others to get it done. These are skills that most people develop over years in the workplace, so I would not expect a PhD student to have obtained them yet."
"Chip, doesn't always make decisions, sometimes he defers to Owen, when he should make the decision himself."
Chris was able to lead groups of students in a manner that both parties respected each other and work was positive.
Clary lead in many ways amongst his peers.
Colleen has a well balanced skill set for a writing/editing position but I would have to say that leadership in the team is where she could most improve. other members of the team have been very independent and while Colleen would clearly like a greater level of collaboration she's not been able to find the common ground on which to build that. Leadership is often the most difficult skill for students to learn and I think that with another semester on the team she could make great strides.
Colleen is just starting to grow in the area of Leadership in learning to take ownership of her projects.
Collin is quiet and reserved with staff. We would like to groom him to become more involved with mentoring our underrepresented freshmen students.
"Connor works very well on his own and with others, but did not take charge when given the opportunity. He has good leadership qualities and could do well in that capacity, but his performance in this internship showed only his capabilities for following others direction."
Considering that leadership is perceived / exercised differently in an international corporation like Daimler compared to the university level I believe it is common that interns like Jennifer have a hard time to exercise leadership on their own. She brings the necessary tools to be a leader but has had few opportunities yet to execute based on those skills.
Corey can work on planning out the next phases of projects from a high level before going into the details as this will allow him to keep a tighter project schedule. This skill will come with experience as he develops more expertise with projects.
Could be a bit more engaged and take a leadership role in the team
Courtney's unfamiliarity with the field kept her from exercising the confidence needed for leadership.
Create a vision of how an area can be better and set a program to achieve this vision.
Crystal has a take charge lead with great expectations and showing other how to as well.
"Dalvin is pretty quiet, but I feel he could be a fantastic leader given the right opportunity. He's smart and can figure things out quickly."
Damea is very convincing and gets her ideas across well. She can improve in encouraging input from others.
"Danielle didn't have many opportunities to demonstrate her leadership skills while she was with us; however, I believe she would have great skill and confidence in anything that she attempted, so continuing to develop her leadership skills when given the opportunity would be to her benefit."
David has done a wonderful job serving as the lead on many projects to deliver great results.
Deepa needs to learn to share her knowledge and understanding of technology and processes to better engage others into her projects.
Deidra has one of the hardest group of mentees to wor with (transfer students) but she has been able to reach them and for a great group of students.
Delaney came into this internship already participating in several of the programs that I am involved in. She was able to take our work to the next level by taking the lead and forming new partnerships with groups on campus! She also took the lead with our instagram page which has resulted in much more engagement with other students!
"Delaney doesn't see herself as a leader, but I put her into a leadership position of sorts partway through the semester, and she took the reins and ran with it. Although the outcome wasn't what I was hoping (this was for our division intern project...which fell flat on the staff side, mostly, but partly on the intern side), she was willing to allow me to put her into a leadership position for a project that she wasn't initially supposed to lead, and was asked to kind of pick up the pieces and produce a product. They weren't really able to pull it together — unfortunately — but she set off on the right path. There's some work there to do, but I think she has great potential as a future leader."
Delaney has been an intern in the Studio for awhile and you can see the other interns look to her for guidance and help. It is a role she embraces and thrives in.
"Delaney has been tasked to complete one ""big project"" before her internship has finished and was recommended to seek out advise and insight from people in other areas of the business. Although she has done this to an extent, I feel she could make better use of other's knowledge and use it to her advantage. Delaney should feel confident and empowered to ask senior colleagues for advise and help to inform her work."
Demonstrated great leadership with her mentees.
Diamond does a great job taking initiative and following through with her projects. She is also an RA and is a natural leader.
Didn't have much opportunity for this
Displays great leadership with her mentees and guideing them in their freshman year.
"During this next semester, it will be rewarding to see Allie's improvements in this area. I will be asking Allie to lead a project."
"During this semester we identified that Chip would be the best person to lead the Makerspace in the Fall, based, on part, to his leadership skills"
Emily as our senior student intern served as a model and a guide for all of the other interns helping us to integrate them into our workflow very smoothly.
Emily has always been a leader but this year grew in this area even more so being our most senior intern and serving as an example and guide to our other 4 interns.
Emily hasn't had the opportunity to take the lead on a significant project. We plan to begin giving her this opportunity beginning in the spring.
"Emma shows tremendous initiative and maturity in developing, communication and bringing to fruition her vision for Clemson's Sustainability initiatives. She has outstanding leadership skills that will take her far in her career."
"Emmaline has had to work with many different stakeholders, including students, faculty, staff and external organizations, and she has been able to achieve her vision in doing so."
"Eric was great at working independently and along with others to achieve project goals and has the capability to be a great leader. During his internship with us he did not take leadership over the projects he was given to bring them to success, rather he relied on others. This may be a note for us and our internship to provide more opportunities for leadership to the students."
"Eva didn't have many opportunities to lead others while in her position. However, when given the chance she jumped at it."
"Even though I consider Ian a great leader he introverts very quickly which isolates his work function, with he knowledge drive and charisma he will be a great leader."
"Even though Reilley is an excellent Cast member, she needs to learn how to lead and push her peers to do better and improve their performance."
"Even though she will be studying abroad in the spring and won’t be interning for the Watt Center, I would still love to keep up with Caroline’s growth in her leadership skills. She is poised, fun to be around and really understands the work she is doing. She is able to see the bigger picture and long-term goals, which would serve her well in leadership roles. I think she possesses many of the characteristics and qualities, now it’s just time for her to pull all of them together as a leader."
"Even though she won’t be interning for the Watt Center this fall, I would still love to keep up with Hannah’s growth in her leadership skills. Hannah follows through on what she says she will do, she makes good decisions, and she has a great personality. She is able to see the bigger picture and long-term goals, which would serve her well in leadership roles. I think she possesses many of the characteristics and qualities, now it’s just time for her to pull all of them together as a leader."
"Everyone have our own personality and its good to understand the variety, but proactivity and leadership are areas that must be improved everyday, no matters what type of personality you have. In Gwyn's case, leadership is good but shyness kills it. I truly believe that improving this areas will make her a excellent professional."
Fewer opportunities have been provided in this area thus far.
Furthering leadership skills simply requires additional time and experiences to add to her already growing knowledge.
Gabrielle didn't have a lot of opportunities to show off her leadership skills.
"Great intern and a great person to work with. This is the only area that I can think of that would need improvement, which will come with experience."
Great leader of the interior design team. Takes charge and does not hesitate to advance the team by collaborating with faculty and staff.
"Great on operating about everything especially heavy equipment, and watching behind it to make sure it’s not destroying any turf. Good motivator. Brandon is punctual and on time 30 minutes early each day. Brandon can make decisions on his own without much guidance. Brandon takes on any task assigned to him with enthusiasm and completes it with great precision."
Hannah has successfully lead two project teams this semester. She is able to keep everyone on task and complete all the work on time.
Hannah is always taking leadership initiatives within her UPIC position. She is given certain tasks and will go above and beyond to complete the task and also bring in additional roles.
"Hannah is just starting her career and as such may not have had the opportunity to demonstrate practical application in this area, however she is confident in her dealing with people."
Hannah saw where improvements needed to be made in the program and took leadership over developing new solutions.
Having one semester working in the Makerspace enables Nathan to be a great leader in this space next semester.
Having worked in the Makerspace one Semester Jarod is well placed to be a great leader next semester.
Hayley has great skills and just needs the experience to become a great leader.
He can become frustrated with other's weaknesses/be overly critical. This could make him more independent than he needs to be.
He constantly impresses all of us by taking charge of his project
"He did a great job tapping into employees knowledge. It is hard to gain the confidence to tap into higher level plant leaders in a summer, but that would be the next step in leadership growth in this category."
"He has very successfully taken the VR Immersive Space form a concept to a reality. He has earned the respect of all who work with him - students, faculty and staff."
He is a natural leader. He takes charge and does things first. He puts the example.
He is not an outgoing person so stepping into a leadership role and understanding group dynamics can be hard for Andrew.
"He is very confident in this particular field, he was made for it. He commits to learning something new every day. His work ethic, sacrifice and commitment are unheard of for a guy his age! Jonathan conducts himself in a professional manner and has represented Gray Engineering well. He has learn many skills that will allow him to be a successful engineer in the future, such as AutoCAD, stormwater calculations, hydrology calculations, and utility construction field testing. Jonathan has also learned to communicate with regulatory agencies and our clients when needed."
"He is very organize, passionate toward every subject, and displays a well leadership skill."
"He lack a little self-motivation that could have been reflective of his leadership style, which was not as assertive. He also simply wasn't given a lot of opportunity to showcase leadership skills with some of the work we did this summer."
"He not only understands his strength and weakness, but he recognizes others' strength and weakness. When he develops leadership skills, he can be better at working with others, encouraging and supporting other team members by recognizing individual skills and competency."
He often waited on others to respond to tasks first.
He should continue to improve on his leadership skills.
He showed to be the natural leader of the other UPIC students. He motivated the others to do the needed tasks and was the first to respond to requests.
"He thrives in a group environment, and I believe he would benefit from more leadership tasks."
He understood his assignment and took the leadership to achieve goals.
"Her leadership skills are still strong, but has difficulty engaging others in projects."
"His role in this internship did not specifically require the leadership skill, but it will be necessary in his future career."
"Honestly, I don't know if this program put Ryan in too many situations where he needed to demonstrate leadership of this sort. He is a very well rounded student and did a very good job in this internship."
"Honestly, in a co-op position, surrounded by full time employees, there is not much opportunity to demonstrate leadership."
"Honestly, it's hard to pick one for this, but I'd say leadership. I think she will be a great leader one day, but is just getting her feet under her so she does have a lot to work on (as do we all). But she's willing to have conversations, willing to lead a conversation, willing to step out and be vulnerable, ask questions and take constructive feedback. And those are all great traits of good leaders."
Horace displays great leadership with his mentee by guiding them in tho great academia study habits and when he sees a need of them he goesinto action.
I am not sure if this is applicable as Mokarram was not placed in a position where he could demonstrate leadership. However I believe that in the future if placed in these situations he could learn and grow in this area.
"I am working at University of Texas at El Paso. Yunhui Peng worked in the summer to help my research group to conduct several research topics. During his stay, he performed as a leader to organize and conduct the research with several other junior researcher/students."
I believe as Allison gains more experience her ability to take on more leadership roles - she most definitely has the key characteristics that will allow her to be a leader.
"I believe Jenna can grown the area of voicing her own opinions in a larger group setting--she has so much to say but often does not. I believe that this internship has helped her take ownership of one of our particular tools, our newsletter, as she has advocated for various updates and made it her own--and I would love to see her do this in other areas of her academic, professional, and social life."
"I believe that I didn't provide her with enough opportunities to grow in this area. Next fall semester, she will be working with us in a FT UPIC position, and will be managing several larger projects on her own. This will help her gain more experience in this competency."
I cannot answer this question and made a selection only because forced to by the software.
"I chose leadership since Mary Elizabeth did not have the opportunity to lead in our research assistant position. As she progresses in her education and career, I'm sure Mary Elizabeth will encounter situations in which she will embrace the chance to develop and grow as a leader."
"I could have chosen several for LaMarr, but I chose Leadership because LaMarr has demonstrated excellent leadership skills this semester, especially with his team of Student Event Coordinators. LaMarr has so much positive energy that he is able to lead by example. His positive attitude and outlook has also been encouraging to others this semester. LaMarr has done a fantastic job at sharing ideas, setting goals for himself and the team and supporting others during very busy times. LaMarr also expressed interest in cross-training in our department and took advantage of opportunities to do so. LaMarr is only a freshmen so I look forward to watching (and hopefully mentoring) him as he continues to develop into an even stronger leader!"
"I did not experience Ashley utilizing leadership skills to her full potential. She definitely is a leader, and I think she would excel if given the opportunity."
"I didn't give Daniel many opportunities to leverage others' strengths to achieve a vision. However, the couple of times he was in charge of others, I saw great potential to be an effective leader, but room for improvement as well. Daniel can sometimes allow emotions to supersede his decision-making skills when tensions increases in a situation."
"I didn't see Maggie take a leadership role in leveraging her free time into new areas. Once an intern is trained into the job, he or she usually sees a few hours a week open to additional projects. Maggie seemed content to do only what was necessary - even when asked to do more. This internship has a lot of freedom built into it, and I ask each intern to identify a need and solve it during the last month they are here. She didn't take authority, rather just waited to be told what to do."
"I do not believe Erika is always able to identify others strengths. She gets others involved, but do not know if she sees the strengths youth have or the potential they have in all situations."
I do not find any of these to be a particular area of weakness; but select leadership only because it is not an area where I've had the opportunity to position Wajdi in a team allowing him to take on such roles.
I do not see this as a weakness - I think A'va is well rounded in all of these competencies. I would like to see her utilize those strengths in positions of leadership to continue to grow and develop her resume.
"I do wish we had more opportunities to evaluate this competency. Autumn is a very quick and decisive worker, which comes with many advantages. At the same time, I believe her work style may miss opportunities to share ideas and connect. My encouragement for her would be to identify that goal, and develops tasks towards that goal, but take the time to reflect, research, organize, and modify with the input of others."
"I don't believe Jacob has had the opportunity to develop his leadership skills extensively at this time. This takes a certain amount of experience and time to develop to a high degree, as working with various personalities can be challenging. When given the opportunity, I am certain that he will develop these skills and prove to be a very competent leader."
"I don't know that he doesn't have this leadership skill, it was just not demonstrated in the internship. I don't think I gave him a real opportunity to show his leadership skills."
"I don't really feel like there is an area where she could improve. But, if i had to choose one i would say this one simply because we all can strive to improve in this area. This will simply come with experience as she grows in her career."
"I feel leadership is the greatest are for improvement for Krystin because she is willing to take on any task given to her, but does not take the lead herself. While she has been my social media & marketing intern for 3 rotations, she still lacks some initiative to get projects started and push other marketing interns to do the same."
"I feel that Andrew will be a strong future leader. That is why he now need a strong mentor to help him in this future role. While at TripAdvisor, he felt that he was not in a position to lead,, and so he relied on others to lead. Yet, I feel with proper training and mentorship, he will become a very strong leader"
"I feel that leadership comes with experience and while he shows the qualities to be a leader, this will come with time and opportunities."
"I feel that Melissa will be a great leader. She most definitely has all the qualities of a great leader. The one area she could improve upon would be her assertiveness and confidence in her ability. By improving in these areas, she will excel in whatever career path she chooses. She has fantastic ideas related to program development and improvement. The only thing that is lacking is her assertiveness in presenting her ideas and the confidence in her ideas and visions. She has started to grow, and I believe will continue to grow professionally as a leader."
"I feel that Mikaela is a leader, but true leadership takes a while to master so she could continue to work on this area."
"I felt that she was a bit reluctant to ask for help from other team members. If she could organize a better team work, I guess, it would not only be helpful for her, but the study would be done in a more efficient way."
"I guess leadership comes with experience and knowledge of the job and tasks to complete. She is still a young student and once her professional skills will advance, she would start feeling more confident to guide others and being more proactive on making decisions or suggestions."
I have ask James to faciliate one of our weekly meeting and he does with ease. Alos with his mentee's he displays great leadership skill.
I have not been able to provide Alyssa opportunities to lead since we are a very small operation. I am unable to truthfully access this question and will work to make sure she gets some leadership opportunities in the future.
"I have seen John display leadership with our summer bridge program. He is skilled at being supportive, advising and encouraging to students, assisting them in their transition to college."
"I have seen Kylie grow in speaking up and sharing her perspective in a group. I think she has gained confidence. She has continued room for improvement here in leading other, communicating her perspective, and helping lead groups."
"I honestly have not had many opportunities to witness Maddie's ability to articulate a vision for an assignment or assess the skills of others to achieve that vision. Usually, she is implementing the vision that the director of the Faculty Senate and I determine, but hopefully as she gets more comfortable with our office operations and her fellow intern peers in the spring I can scaffold some experiences to allow her to grow in this area."
I honestly think Trevor is a great leader. He honestly utilized other interns strengths. But if I had to choose one for an area of improvement it would be leadership because we can always continue to grow.
I hope her can learn to how to lead others to do sth instead of always herself finish all the things others cannot do that.
"I often feel this is the area for improvement. In all of my employees and myself. Brooklyn is no different. Brooklyn is great at organization and development. She is great at design and implementation. She wants everything perfect and I admire that. For that reason and the fact she has had to work alone in the past to accomplish tasks, I feel she just doesn't have the experience in delegating and leading a team. I do however, feel that she will excel when she has the opportunity to develop in this area."
I only chose leadership because there was not much of an opportunity for our interns to display that competency much with this project.
"I only pick this because we do not put her in charge of others (in our current setup, we really can't) so I don't think our internship has allowed her to improve in this way."
I only say this because I feel the position doesn't necessitate Alyx to oversee the work of others. I do think she would be a fine leader!
"I picked this one, because I had to pick one in order to submit the form. I do not have concerns regarding his leadership skills. Wajdi has not had an opportunity to execute leadership very much yet. He has done an excellent job with helping a student. As my group grows and I have more students with programming abilities I am sure that Wajdi will be a great asset to my group and a great leader."
I rank Kshitij as having the greatest area of improvement in the Leadership category simply due to time in his position. Learning the strengths and limitations of others takes time. Kshitij simply hasn't had enough time in his position to establish himself as a leader. I genuinely have no doubts that Kshitij will develop into a fantastic lead engineer in his career.
"I really do not see Erin as lacking in leadership, but Leadership was probably the least displayed trait (not even by her own fault, but at the fault of my design of the program)."
"I really don't have much to complain about with Emilie. This internship she undertook did not really give her the opportunity to demonstrate her leadership capabilities. Thus, I hope she will have the opportunity to demonstrate them in a future endeavor. This is not so much of an 'area for improvement', but I hope she is able to gain experience in this area nonetheless."
I really want to see Ely's leadership experience grow and her confidence to lead our intern team. She's the veteran on this team and I would love to see her lead with that experience more. I'm waiting for her to be more vocal in our team meetings.
I selected Leadership because being a great leader defines Meghan Williams and if you are a great leader you possess the other skills mentioned. She will go far in life as she has the confidence and the ability to make decisions and lead others. It is a joy to have Meghan as an intern and watch as she grows and hones her talents and skills. She works well both independently and in a team setting.
"I selected leadership not because I think Alice is particularly lacking in this area, but because I think we need to do a better job of providing her (and other interns) with opportunities to display this quality. I would say there's not as much collaboration in my work site as there is at others, which leaves fewer opportunities for any of the interns to assume a traditional leadership role. However, because of what I've seen Alice do in terms of leading a project (even if she's the only one working on it), I think she shows a lot of promise and I would be interested to learn more about her leadership style in a group."
I suspect he would excel in this area as well but we just didn't get the chance to put him in a leadership role this semester.
I think as Ryan grows in his self confidence he will improve in this area.
I think Bruce could take a bit more initiative to take the lead and make suggestions when working on projects. I think that this will come as he gains additional experience and continues to develop comfort as part of the team.
"I think Jordan can continue to develop her leadership skills - many times the number of projects going all at one time can be too much for one person, and requires the designer to employ the help of other student designers - with time, I know she will be a great leader and be able to communicate needs to other people effectively while managing her own workload."
"I think Jordan does have great leadership skills and is capable of being a great leader, however in this internship experience there was not much ability for that to show as much as other areas. This is an area that I would love for there to be more areas for her to grow through this internship and an area that we can improve on for next year."
"I think Julia could use more improvement in her leadership. She took on leadership roles for her mentees as well as prospective Clemson students, but it is difficult to develop these skills quickly."
I think just leadership in general. She is such a hard worker but is a little shy by nature. I think her leadership skills will continue to expand as she gains more work experience and knowledge in whatever field she chooses.
"I think leadership is Andy's area for greatest improvement because I believe he has the skills to be a leader, but maybe doesn't seek those leadership positions."
"I think leadership is Natalie's greatest area of improvement because I see leadership in the position as taking initiative and owning a project. While I have tasks for her to do when she comes in, Natalie doesn't take the lead on assignments or initiate new projects."
"I think leadership is something that everyone can always work on, I think this is something I see Abby improving in as she takes on more and more responsibilities within the position and now that she will grow in this and become exemplary at this skill. This is also a skill that she has not had a lot of opportunity to grow this year, but in the next year will have much more opportunity to work on."
"I think Liz has a lot of leadership potential and is already a leader in many regards, but based on the potential that she has could improve with more experience."
"I think Nick can work more on maximizing the strengths of his peers when he is working with them. He can spot underclassmen strengths when working with them in a coaching, but may not realize how he can do the same with his peers (fellow interns)."
I think Pranav would be a great leader in the Makerspace and something that is achievable for him
"I think that Emily has grown a lot during her internship this summer, but I still think that leadership is her biggest area for continued improvement. Emily has great qualities for leadership, including great vision and ways to improve and increase efficiency within each of the programs. I have really appreciated her input and observations on how to continue to improve our programs. I do think that she has room to improve with trusting herself and her decisions in this area for leadership."
I think that Jared could offer more as a leader in the future. I think it was difficult for him given that he was at intern level in a large international bank but it is an area that he could improve on in the coming years.
"I think that Maddie has great potential for leadership. She has a very calm demeanor, even when the situation may be stressful. She should continue to work and improve on her leadership qualities by taking the lead on additional projects. She has great ideas and is very capable of performing well. I feel that if she increases her self-confidence in her abilities she has the potential to be a great leader in her future career."
I think the greatest way that Claudia could continue to improve would be through her leadership skills. She has taken on a lot of new projects and solo projects this semester. She has definitely risen to each challenge and surpassed all expectations. She has improved as a leader in facilitating sessions and making decisions about scheduling participants. She has been able to give increasingly more input on program development and has really helped the program to progress during her time with us.
I think the students will improve on their leadership skills in their future life.
I think there are leadership roles that would enable Jenson to hone his skills further.
I think this is Krystin's greatest area of improvement because she hasn't had a lot of leadership experience in her previous roles. I'm hoping to give her more of a leadership role in the spring to help lead/train the other interns.
I would have love to see the intern take more leadership role in the office.
I would have preferred to be able to select two competencies - Leadership and Collaboration. I selected Leadership becauseThomas has taken the lead in establishing the VR Immersive Space at the Watt Center. But in doing so he also displayed considerable collaborative and communications skills.
I would like Joseph to take the initiative in reaching out to others in completing his tasks.
I would like to see Niko step up a little bit more during team meetings to express his needs offer his knowledge to others.
"I would like to see Raylan become more vocal at expressing his thoughts and questions when tackling tasks and projects. He does not come off as shy, just on the quiet side. Yet I feel he has the ability to be vocal and take the lead if he had more confidence or experience."
"I would not expect any student undertaking an intern programme to have developed significant leadership skills at her relatively young age. However, I would have no doubt that Olivia will develop these skills as her level of experience increases over the coming years."
"I would not say that Derek struggles with leadership, but just has limited exposure to leading in an industrial environment. I think that Derek can pick this up quickly as he seems like a natural leader, but just needs more time to adjust to newer environments."
I would suggest for Anna to speak up and be more confident. Her work is outstanding and she will make a great leader.
I wouldn't necessarily say she needs major improvement in this area. Her UPIC role
"I’m not sure Tykia has had a lot of opportunities to build her leadership skills, and she didn’t really have a chance her first semester with us. However I see that as she wants to pursue an engineering career, she will benefit from some practice in leadership. As she continues to work with us, my vision is to have her play key roles in training new students and in leading projects. She’s clearly bright and willing to take on these roles."
"I’ve seen how Jenna interacts with other members on our team and the way she is a dedicated team leader. Without my asking her to do so, she often takes the reigns on projects and makes sure things are being finished in a timely manner. She is attentive to detail and keeps me informed of everything going on with the rest of our team when I am taking care of other projects. She has shown a great deal of leadership this semester and has been my go-to intern when I need anything done."
"Ian could improve in the area of leadership. It is one thing to work well with others, but another to achieve a goal while strengthening a team and leveraging the various skill sets at your disposal."
"If Riddhi's see's a better way of doing a design, she should offer it up front."
"I'm deeply impressed by Wajdi. While I am certain we all have considerable room for improvement in many areas, I'm honestly unable to presently identify which of these would be the greatest opportunity for advance in his case. That said, I haven't yet explicitly expected leadership attributes from him, and have been sufficiently immersed in my Chair roles that I'm uncertain of the degree to which he's expressed leadership properties in his first-semester work with us."
I'm not sure if this is necessarily an area of improvement but I haven't had the chance to evaluate this competency through this role.
"I'm sure Dalvin would be a fantastic leader, but as a new intern it wasn't something that was expected of him and it's pretty much the only category that would fit."
I'm unable to assess his leadership skills since he works on an individual project. I haven't seen any evidence that he's reached out to others.
"In his position on the jobsite, Tyler hasn't been given a great deal of opportunity for leadership. I think given an enhanced opportunity to lead a group, Tyler will do very good."
In our small setting Deron did not have a great opportunity to show off his leadership abilities. I think this can be an area that he could work on.
"In the beginning of his internship Max felt it was difficult to impose his leadership to others, but with the guiding of us, we have seen an impressive improvement in this area. He used several new techniques to feel better about himself and turning his weaker points in stronger ones."
"In this UPIC role, there hasn't been too much opportunity for ""leveraging others' strengths to achieve a vision""; which I would consider organization/personnel management leadership. However, I do believe she demonstrates leadership skills in terms of project management."
Inadequate opportunity
Interaction and open communication is the key to success and flawless execution of tasks. While Unnati showed already a great way of doing so I would like to encourage her to further improve it his area since I believe it to be the key factor for success.
"Intern does not want to take lead role in tasks, she is an excellent doer. Hesitant to put herself in a leadership type role."
"Intern has strong leaderships skills that, through further development, will help position for future jobs"
Intern is working in a field that he lacks experience. Once intern develops confidence in an area his leadership skills may very well kick in.
"Intern really didn't show any weaknesses. Of all of the areas listed above, this trait was not demonstrated as strongly as the others."
Intern showed progressive leadership skills among peers in projects or personal endeavors
"Intern would benefit from more leadership training in prep for future positions and collaborations, building upon leadership skills already present"
It is important when working with a large team and organization that communication is very clear and sometimes that even means verbal communication. His natural personality is more quiet/timid and if he strives to be a leader in Gray Court it is important for him to learn to speak clearly and affectively with colleagues.
"It is really hard to evaluate this given the situation. We (the mentors) were really the leaders in our areas of expertise, the intern was more focused on learning and presenting to others. However, it takes a leader to maintain the confidence to teach effectively."
It is super hard to lead your peers. Melissa had challenges with a group member who would miss deadlines or not respond to communication. She ended up taking on the work herself instead of dealing with the situation.
"It may just be the circumstance of being an intern and the lack of opportunity to really show true leadership, but Edi has great potential to become a leader in this field."
It's difficult to identify an area that needs improvement. She did so well in every aspect of her position. Leadership was selected but honestly only because that really wasn't anything she was exposed to.
it's my perception that he just hasn't yet had opportunities necessary to learn and grow in this area. strengthening upward/outward influencing skills will help with his research as he seeks inputs from all levels of our company.
"It's not a weakness, but as good as Walker is - he can be a true leader in life!"
"Izzy worked extremely hard in the Makerspace and provided great leadership to the students. This semester the Makerspace provided support to over 300 students from all majors. However, she did not get the opportunity to become a leader within the staff team. I believe she is ready for this role in the coming semester."
Jack excels already in most other areas. Developing advanced leadership skills would be the natural next step while he is progressing on his career path.
Jackson was able to lead a team of a dozen student hourly workers to maintain a safe and accessible environment for students of all backgrounds to learn machine tool practices
Jacob has done an excellent job with helping to lead a cross department internship project with multiple interns in multiple different disciplines. He has taken such an interest that he has been able to contribute an amazing idea and lead a group of interns around the goal and objectives and art for that job. All of this is going to be group presented to the mentors/supervisors on a subject matter that is really needed.
Jacovia works well with others and has demonstrated the ability to use others' strengths to complete tasks.
Jade's ability to lead and inspire those around her is inspiring and a great reflection of her success in this internship. She encouraged her residents (members of the Wellness LLC) to be well and take part in different wellness opportunities on campus.
Jade's involvement in this internship and across campus has strengthened her leadership skills tremendously. She is never afraid to pitch new ideas and collaborate with campus partners to make them happen.
Jake is a leader! He helps others to see their potential and uses their strengths to help accomplish the tasks presented to him and the group. He isn't afraid to get his own hands dirty and leads alongside others.
Jake is easy to work with and communicates well. I think that he could grow in taking initiative and leadership when working with others.
James just started to take on a leadership role in the last couple months - he is just learning to lead.
Jasmine found it hard to share assignments with other interns and student staff. She was very conscious about wanting to make sure assignments were done thoroughly.
"Jenna did a great job of leading, but she could work on being a stronger leader and ensuring the members do their parts."
"Jenna possesses a great deal of potential for leadership within our internship group. When she returns in the spring I would like to see her step up and become the lead intern in our department. I think her vision and work ethic during projects would benefit the group as a whole, and I am interested in seeing her help other interns gain skills they don't currently possess. All of the pieces and components are there, but I want to see how they come together in future semesters at the Watt Center."
Jessica has been interning with the On Campus Extension Office for 3 semesters now. She does a wonderful job at leading the office and working with newer interns to meet goals and objectives!
Jillian does good work when given very specific tasks.
"John haven't had a chance to provide guidance and lead others, as he is mostly works by himself. Hopefully, he will have the chance in the future."
John still has a lot to learn in terms of leadership. He can be shy at times.
Jonathan has the ability to take initiative and lead very well.
Jordan is incredibly bright and talented. She was competent and completed her work. At times she seemed to lack the confidence to dig deep into projects. I valued Jordan's work ethic and would expect given more time in our organization she would gain the confidence needed to tackle larger projects and take on additional responsibilities.
Jordin could work on stepping up and taking more leadership roles. She could look for places to take initiatives.
Joseph should take the initiative in leading.
Judith is building confidence in herself and will soon feel the ability to lead others.
Julia has done a great job working with us. I think her ability to train others on continuing her projects will be her biggest area for improvement.
Julia is very quiet and reticent. This presented her with some challenges as she led a group of undergraduates from diverse fields in analyzing qualitative data.
"Juliana will be a leader, she has already showcased her leadership ability in our office, as well as on her study abroad program this spring. I think that with time she will hone this skills to her's and her employer's advantage."
"Justin has great technical skills and knowledge, is adaptable and resilient and a reliable worker. His previous terms have been project-oriented with a set goal, and I want to encourage him to lead the projects in future terms to give him a chance to demonstrate his capacity to be a leader."
"Karan needs to take a more active role in building group oriented collaboration where he could network more with internal associates, build relationships, find ways to complement business efforts."
"Katie has all the necessary skills to move to the next level, and begin to explore leadership roles in organizations she is involved in."
"Kayce is hard working beyond most students I have worked with over several decades. I know that is a big statement. But it is also appropriate. Kayce made a point to be sure that she was getting what she should from this program. She has been great at working directly with people. She excels in her efforts (and success) in hiring, training and coaching new employees. Kayce has been wonderful at staying on top of her tasks and keeping them organized while getting them done in a timely manner. She is also great at keeping a level head when conflict arises and works to make sure that she understands things from the other person's perspective before she acts. When it comes to management, she exhibits strong leadership skills that will serve her well in life. "
"Kendal has a quiet demeanor but is very organized, goal-oriented, and seems to have a good handle on balancing school and work. We plan on training him to be one of our mentors, working more with our incoming underrepresented STEM freshmen."
Kendal led well but I think that he could be a little stronger in his leadership skills
Kimberly worked well with her mentees in guiding them to get involved with campus activities.
"Laycee managed 6-7 people this summer. With her leadership, morale improved and so did the level and quality of work. She was not afraid to take on hard tasks and make schedules work. She took on projects head on and got them finished. She is an assets to the farm."
"Leadership - Madi is a great leader but if she can take her charisma, drive, and energy, and find away to replicate that in other humans, she will change the world."
"Leadership is a difficult talent which requires practice if not innate. This is his greatest area for improvement because he lacks the hands on experience necessary to be a tactful and effective leader, however he does have a natural ability to lead others and will become an excellent leader one day."
Leadership is a field where I feel he needs to improve. He has improved lot but he still needs to work on the responsibility towards projects he is involved him. He needs to be more and more process oriented and shall work towards his accountability.
Leadership is a quality BMW expects from all of it's associates and would be an area for development. This is not to say that Dheeraj is lacking leadership qualitities but in his role it is difficult to assess his ability in this area.
Leadership is an area I have not witnesses as much. She works hard in the office and is willing to help outside of the office. Have not witnessed her leading others.
"Leadership is an area that I believe that Kiah has the most potential. She is already on a path to grow as a leader by being involved in so many campus organizations, particularly the Chapman Scholars Leadership Program. She is in the first year of this three-year program, so there is still a lot of learning and development to be done. I know that Kiah will accomplish great things as a student leader and beyond."
"Leadership is Michael's greatest area for and opportunity for improvement, especially in regards to intentional collaboration with fellow interns; communicating his leadership role and qualities will be vital to partnering with the other returning intern next semester."
Leadership is relatively weak
Leadership is very important in all companies. Liana improved her leadership.
"Leadership skills in the design industry happens over years of experience. I think through time, Kelly will improve and attain leaderships skills needed to manage and coordinate projects."
Leadership skills often increase with time spent in professional environments. I feel as his career advances he will continue to develop leadership skills and will quickly find opportunities to move into leadership positions.
Leadership was selected only because of limited opportunity for leadership as an intern over a summer.
"Leadership, because this is a necessary trait to manage the student shop"
"Leadership, this one takes time and confidence which is something I know she will achieve she just has to learn more and be more secure in her knowledge base."
Leadership-Was unable to assess
Leads the autonomy team; provides coherence and instills rigor into the team
"Leads the electrical powertrain team, guiding his teammates as a well-oiled machine"
Leads the IC engine team. Makes sure things get done and keeps the entire team motivated.
Led a team project
Lillian has evolved into an outstanding leader. She has typically been very quiet for years but in the last year she has risen into this huge calm abiding force for good. She has become a natural leader with integrity and ethical values beyond question.
"Lillie has the capacity to take a task and ""run with it"" and to take initiative in identifying and undertaking tasks and office projects, which she would do on occasion, but not consistently. When she comes back to the Clemson Abroad office for a full-time internship during the fall 2019 semester, I would love to see her rise to that next level of initiative."
Lily is new in the corporate world and she is constantly learning. During the internship we made it a point to expose her to leadership improvement opportunities. These leadership skills complement her analytical skills and help her growth.
"Lindsey is always one of the first on the team to have ideas, offer feedback and opinions, and offer direction in meetings."
Mackenzie is excellent at utilizing others strengths to achieve a vision and goal
"Maddie did the jobs that were handed and did not ask much more than what was asked of her, I believe that she will be better at any job if she asks questions as to what the job will do for the company and understand a company operations."
"Maddie honestly possesses very advanced skills in all of these areas of competence, but I picked leadership for this session simply because her work this summer was somewhat isolated and she was our only office intern. So she did not have the opportunity to demonstrate team-building leadership skills with any collaborators. I know she will in the fall when I onboard two new UPIC interns and she will need to be a mentor for both of them, identifying their skills and helping me utilize them in the office operations and her specific event planning duties. I look forward to seeing those efforts unfold."
Madison mostly worked with other interns and did not really have the opportunity to show leadership skills in the short time period.
"Maggi has the potential to be a great leader. At this point in her development, she simply hasn't had the same amount of practice in this area as she has in other areas. However, she is already well-developed in other areas, such as communication, collaboration, adaptability, and analytical skills, which are important for being a strong leader, so she is will on her way!"
"Maggy has not had a ton of opportunity thus far to showcase her leadership. Hopefully, we can find areas for her to step up and continue to grow in this area."
Manan improved his leadership in the company. I would recommend to improve it more and more.
Maren is a great leader but could continue to grown in her leadership as she develops the ability find a utilize the strengths of everyone in whichever group setting she is in.
"Margeaux maintained professionalism in the office in that she was well organized, neat, focused on the work at hand. She can improve on encouraging and motivating her peers, and on interacting with them to express her enjoyment of their being on the team with her. She also struggled with following rules relating to no texting or using smart phones while in the office at your desk, despite having received those rules clearly in writing and verbally."
Mary leads the student team tasked with all data acquisition for the upcoming forest products sale. She has excellent people skills and is very adept at networking with others to complete assignments.
Mary took responsibility for and excelled at leading a team of student workers. The team was tasked with inventory acquisition for sale information as well as stand research data.
"Matthew is a Sophomore, and he is new to a leadership position. He struggled to meet the 160 hour commitment this semester. He was rarely on schedule to log the nominal hours each week, so he had a lot of work to do at the end of the semester to meet his goals. He has the potential to be a strong leader, so this UPIC internship was very valuable for him.In another year or two he will be outstanding."
Mattie was able to successfully lead her team to promote the new Guide App for students. She organized all the events and made sure she increased the downloads.
"Max could do more to embrace opportunities that arise for leadership among his peers; he has the knowledge and communication skills to effectively lead, but is still working on the confidence in those abilities necessary to accept more leadership as part of a team."
"Max has a lot of opportunity to improve in the area of leadership in the sense that he is a very efficient independent worker, and could benefit from including others in projects that he is working on in a way that allows everyone involved to use their strengths to accomplish a shared vision and create an even better finished product."
"McKenna has wonderful leadership qualities that I've been able to witness during my time with her, but I see a lot more potential for her to emerge as a leader among her peers. I think this is something she is certainly capable of and will master with more time."
McKenzie did a great job encouraging groups of volunteers to help out in difficult situations. She was able to see a need and bring groups together and help solve problems.
"Meagan has truly been a leader, not just in the SEC area, but as a leader for all of our student employees. Her professionalism, strong ability to lead meetings, and creativity has led her to have an important role in our department."
"Melissa has grown a lot in her leadership abilities over the last semester and continues to improve every day. Melissa has had to take on additional leadership roles as a facilitator for the Diabetes Prevention Program. She became a certified DTTAC Diabetes Prevention Program Lifestyle Coach and was able to facilitate sessions on her own. Over the last semester she has led several one-on-one and group class sessions. She continues to grow in her leadership abilities as she has helped to plan, schedule, recruit, enroll participants in a DPP cohort."
Melissa was placed in a leadership position this semester and really embraced the role. She was like a mentor to the interns that reported to her and really excelled in leading them to a successful semester.
"Michael is great at following directions and getting and responding to feedback, but could step up more to lead and organize others as they work together on projects."
"Mihir needs to improve leadership decision making capabilities. However, these abilities of his were not tested because he was in a junior role."
"Mikayla was put in a position of leadership for a couple of events. While she handled herself pretty well, she will likely further develop her leadership skills as she has more opportunities to practice leading."
more comfortable following
More convincing on advantages of his ideas
Morgan has the knowledge base to manage other areas (depts) involved in her scope of work. She should work to become a leader by gaining the confidence needed to delegate tasks and create a stable & successful process for all areas involved in the supply chain.
Morgan is an outstanding leader and one of the most impressive students I have ever supervised. She is able to create and convey a plan and build a team into a successful unit.
Mr. Mukherjee is a junior graduate student and has not gotten a lot of opportunities to practice and demonstrate his leadership potential. This should be improved once he becomes senior and gets more experience in leading the team on the research projects.
Mr. Prasad is very intelligent but seems to be a bit shy at times. I'd like to encourage him to break out of his shell and speak up more often. I can definitely see him being a phenomenal leader in the future.
Ms. Dale is very intellectually aggressive and driven.
"Much less a reflection on Emily, as the role had limited potential for leadership outcomes; Emily actually did serve as a leader among her peers, both as a senior of high academic performance, highly involved in student life and various organizations, as well as a subject matter expert who had regular opportunities to advise students on global engagement opportunities in her college. That said, I'd love to see Emily apply herself in increasing leadership roles as she transitions to a regular full-time position after graduation. I have full confidence that she'll do great things for her new employer!"
"My encouragement to all students is that Collaboration and Leadership skills are critical to students for long term success in this field. Once you have established command of a technology and are good at analyzing and solving problems, which is the fundamental element and never ending challenge of the computer science and engineering fields, the two skills that are going to take you the farthest in your career will be collaborating/working together on the team despite the circumstances, and secondly, leadership if you want the distinction, the risks, and the rewards of both success and failure. Management and corporate leadershp will recognize and reward both collaboration and leadership skills in different ways. I selected Leadership not because it is an area for improvement, but because I see the potential in this individual as having natural leadership skills already, and just needs to capitalize on those skills."

Nafiseh needs to be able to articulate why the problem is important for her and why solving the problem will be impactful. Hopefully she gains this maturity with experience in her PhD and beyond.
"Namrata was not asked to lead or innovate, which could be assessed in a future position. However, her curiosity and attention to detail demonstrated her potential to grow and develop herself in those areas. I recommend that Namrata leverages her leadership education and acquires more assertiveness, she definitely could use some practice - but that was not required in this role."
Natalia needs to be more aggessive and less passive in her leadership skills
Need more confidence to bring leadership development to the next level.
Need more to be proactive in driving new ideas
Need to take charge more and initiatives and not be a follower.
needs experience in leading a group
"Needs higher comfort level to get people around her excited about work, but this is very minor."
Nick did not have many opportunities to develop this skill
"Nicole has great potential for leadership. As a student at this point in her career, she is often executing the vision of others. I encourage her to seek opportunities to develop and grow her own vision in both her work and service."
"Nicole has grown leaps and bounds since she started as a freshman. It astounds me to think about the young lady who started here in August 2017 and to see how much she has transformed since that time. She has come out of her shell, become more outgoing and assertive, etc. I see her leadership skills growing every single time she is in the office. I don’t list leadership as the greatest area for improvement because she lacks these skills; on the contrary, in the coming semesters I know she will be the best leader for the Media and Graphics team. Nicole is a fun presence in the office and one of my favorite students I’ve worked with in my time as a professional. She should take advantage of every opportunity to continue to develop her leadership skills, both at the Watt Center and in other extracurricular campus activities, because it will only take her even further than she’s already going to go in life. As we move into the fall semester, Nicole will be taking on the role of lead intern for my Media and Graphics team. I can’t wait to see how she takes this role and makes it her own as a leader and creative individual. Her final year of her undergraduate career will mold these skills into a formidable force in her future endeavors."
Nik was put into the highest leadership role early on in his time with our staff. He has improved a lot on his leadership skills but there is still room to grow.
No opportunity to assess this area.
None at all. He is top notch.
"None of these options are weaknesses for Daniel, and he is quite balanced across all of them, so its hard to choose one, and I am waffling between Collaboration and Leadership because they work together. Out of good collaborative experiences, strong leaders will emerge. If Daniel masters the art of leadership over the next few years of his life, I think he will be unstoppable, and will be the next generation of rising stars for any company or organization he works for."
"Not yet experienced in this skill, however opportunity hasn't been presented."
"Notice a willingness to work and be part of the team but nor to drive and ""take charge"" and own a specific part of the project. It could well be that this competence did not come out as the project did not require this skill."
"Olivia was shy at first but after she became comfortable in her position, she excelled and came up with her own ideas to help market our facility."
"Once Katelyn has a change to work more, see a bigger variety of task and works her way up in a firm, she has great potential to o,prove her leadership skills. She is always positive and read to help everyone any way she can."
Once Nicole gains confidence and experience she will be a natural leader in any field she chooses.
One of those people who has it all; technically strong; super well-organized; and able to motivate and inspire his teammates
Only because I do not think he was able to get a lot of leadership experience in this role.
only because she tended to prefer to work by herself and didn't take on a leadership role
Only because we didn't really provide or encourage the opportunity for her to really lead any aspect of the work she did.
only two months in the company
"Our office hasn't given Charlotte many opportunities to have a leadership role, but, we're confident, if given, she would excel."
"Paige is great at collaborating, however, she rather take on projects herself - in order to learn and grow - instead of delegating them."
Pain & simple it's just experience and maturation...I feel he will get to a point where this is a strength.
"Part of the job description for this internship is that students will identify promotional/marketing needs that we lack at the Watt Center and work to fill those gaps. I am a one-person department here, so I rely heavily on the help of my interns to complete projects and ensure that we have new, fresh content going out for all of our marketing and promotions. I make it clear during the interview process that there will be days that I expect interns to look for projects on their own and develop a plan for completion. We meet regularly as a team and I check in with interns at almost every shift, but I also want the students to develop their own ideas and work with one another to bring those ideas to life. Emme never displayed any sort of self-motivation or “go-getter” attitude during the internship. She would wait for me to bring her projects during each shift, or she just wouldn’t check in to see what needed to be done. I feel like I spent a vast majority of the semester “hand-holding” and prodding her to complete projects, even after I gave her all of the materials she would need. She came highly recommended by a fantastic previous UPIC intern in my area (who turned out to be a great leader for my team), so I was hoping to see her really step into her own as a leader. I know she is very talented and there’s a lot of potential for growth in the future."
Patrick has grown in his involvement with our PEER WISE outreach events; from being just a participant or worker to a leader. He volunteers for assignments to give back to others. Students gravitate to him and he encourages them in their educational pursuits.
Patrick has worked well with SHPE and PEER as a mentor to help bring more awarenees of the Hispanic community and getting his mentees involved in community events and academically.
Position did not provide a platform for leadership so can't assess how student would do in leadership situation.
"Quanyi is advanced in all areas, however, given the position she was in and the short time period in which I was able to observe her work, there was not much opportunity for Qianyi to show her leadership skills. This is the only reason why I would list it as an area for improvement. She was an excellent worker."
Quiet and shy; but knows how to work well with others
"Rachel is very capable and works well with others but seems to shy away from initiating a lead position. However, with encouragement she does an excellent job accomplishing the assigned task or project."
Rachel spearheaded many of the activities for her fellow mentors and guided her mentees with excellance
"Reagan is diligent and I would like to see her confidence continue to improve as she works with the rest of our team. As our youngest and one of our newest interns, I think Reagan will continue to learn and feel more confident in leading our ""intern team"" with additional semesters, but we have already seen her maturity grow significantly over the course of the semester."
"Reagan is pretty quiet and shy, but he is extremely knowledgeable. His intellect could translate into leadership down the road."
"Reagan is strong in all of these areas, but I see leadership as her greatest untapped resource. With her exceptional communication and collaboration skills, I think she can progress to the next level by taking leadership on projects and helping others gain the confidence that she displays."
Recognizing that providing others the opportunity to lead will help in their overall development.
"Reed can work on finding her ""voice"" whether that is in a one-on-one environment or within a group. She has great talent, but needs to be more vocal about her thoughts and confident in her abilities."
"Riddhi is such a complete employee, picking an area for improvement is very difficult. Her quiet nature lends people to believe she is more passive. What she should focus on when she observes an opportunity is to speak up sooner. Show off her talent. Let people see her leadership skills up front instead of at the end of a project."
Robert could improve in the area of recognizing gifts and skills in others that could prove helpful to the overall vision.
"Roy is hands down the BEST UPIC intern we've ever had the pleasure of working with. Because he excels in every one of the competencies, I'd have to say that Leadership is the greatest strength as his mastery of this concept flows into all of the others."
"Saavon has been a Pearce Center intern for many semesters. He leads many projects for Pearce and we have come to rely on his leadership and seniority. We often have new interns and they look to Saavon for mentorship and guidance. He is able to set a vision and ensure his team members stay on target and complete their tasks, all while being their peer."
Sally did not have any opportunities to build this skill in this internship.
"Sarah has always been a leader on the Rowing team, however, in this internship I witnessed leadership outside of sport. She is very confident and passionate about student-athlete health and wellness. She also should leadership to work with University leaders to secure additional funds for a speaker. The best part was that she took the initiative and was able to deliver. We ended up hosting a speaker and it was a great cross campus collaboration."
"Sarah has really developed into one of the outstanding student leaders at Clemson. Her engagement with her peers as an advisor, assumption of leadership roles - both within her department and the Honors College, and regular commitment to extra- and co-curricular activities (Grand Challenges Scholars, undergraduate research, the sailing team) all helped Sarah to be an exceptional peer ambassador. She was able to leverage her networks and skill sets to help create buzz about study abroad within CECAS, and served as an example of an engineering student who was able to take full advantage of international opportunities while on campus."
"Sarah possesses a great deal of potential in her leadership skills. I can already see her skills emerging in the intern department, but I have no doubts that she will continue to grow as a strong leader in future semesters. She is quick to settle on a course of action, she is never afraid to jump in and help others, and she has a great personality. I really see Sarah becoming a strong guiding force for my intern team in the future."
Savannah is a strong leader. She is able to work with groups of people and leverage strengths to the best benefit of the collective group.
"Self-starting, positive attitude, and creative. 1.) Extremely self motivated with a get-it-done attitude2.) Nic has a great attention to detail and every project he was a part of was completed above and beyond what was asked of him3.) Nic is very reliable when it comes to getting projects completed on time and he requires very little supervision"
Serves as deputy chief engineer and has strong technical authority and a convincing presence.
Serves as DO program manager and is able to pull the entire team together
"Shahab tries to solve many problems on his own, but should try leveraging his team members more to be more efficient"
Shannon led a team of undergraduates from diverse backgrounds and drew from each of their strengths to achieve tremendous results.
"She communicates well with other people, adapts well with any situation and new tasks, and has a great work ethic. However, she sometimes tends to do everything on her own and achieve a goal by herself. I believe that she will be a greater asset in a team/office if she develops leadership skills and learns how to get others involved and utilize others' strength to achieve her or team's goals."
"She did not have an opportunity to really lead others, so I feel that this is something that can always be worked on. But I think she possesses the qualities, just needs the experience."
She didn't have a ton of opportunity to do this — would like to give her more next semester.
She has been able to expand her role as the lead intern and help me delegate tasks to others.
She has had to be pretty much completely in charge of a program that I handed to her
"She has no intern co-workers here this summer, so I couldn't observe leadership skills but I'm sure that she has great ones in a setting with colleagues/co-workers/peers. I don't see this as a greatest area for improvement, but I was forced to choose one."
She has taken on some leadership roles and does a good job. She could do an even better job to keep her group and client informed of the project status.
"She hopes to start presenting workshops next semester, so this would be a great area for improvement! She will also set a great example for career ambassadors in the spring."
She is much more of a follower and could expand on her leadership skills.
"She is not someone who speaks up or be up front and leads a group, however, she has great communication, collaboration and problem solving skills. I believe that if she can further work to find her own leadership skill and observe and identify others' strengths, she will be a great leader and more valuable asset in a team and office."
She just needs to have more confidence in herself when telling people what they have to do.
"She leads by example. The freshmen and change of majors learned much more than the course content from Caroline. They learned study skills, time management, and the importance of communication with faculty, UPICs and peers."
"She works well with others, makes a good observation of people, and has a good foundation to be a great leader. I wish we could give her more opportunities for her to develop her leadership skills throughout her work in our office."
Shyla is a great leader. All of her mentees this year enjoyed her being their mentor. Every time I spoke with one of her mentees they said how much they liked her and how helpful she was. She is also not afraid to speak up and give an opinion.
Shyla was a true leader for her mentees this semester. She has great ideas and leads others to find their strengths as well.
Siddartth worked with suppliers on some critical projects. He lead the internal and external discussion well. The majority of the quality problem finally have been solved and the suppliers performance has been improved.
Sierra did an excellent job using other's strengths to help accomplish her goals.
"Since our department's student intern position is not one who is responsible to keep others on task, it doesn't provide the intern any leadership background. I feel Sam will have no problem in developing leadership traits when he moves into a career and gains more experience."
"Since we could not provide any leadership experience for Sam in the intern position, I am sure he will grow as he is able to guide others in the future. I believe he will have no problem in this area since with us he always has a positive attitude and he inspires positive behavior in all of us."
"So I didn't see a lot of this in her this semester, which is why i'm choosing it for this. I really think she has it in her, but I don't know that she really had an opportunity to do that this semster, either. She tended to work alone, and was generally quiet and focused when in the office, even if other interns were also here at the time. However, she is very driven and focused on doing good work."
Sometimes I think Erika likes doing the things she likes. If she has something personally she wants to do then she is less willing to help with specific projects.
"Sri will be a good leader one day, she has the ability to go far in our industry. Sri needs to gain more confidence in herself, which will come with experience."
Srihith has limited experience working in a corporate setup and would greatly benefit from opportunities where he can lead a group of people.
"Still needs to be able to assert his plan on his team, he works well with the management team above him."
Student has shown great confidence in managing projects and interacting with multiple department within the plant
"Student never really stepped up as a leader of others, though he was an excellent supporter and encouragment to those who were leading."
Sydney is fully qualified to take on a leadership role and just needs to continue looking for those opportunities. Here biggest weakness in this area is not stepping forward and pursuing those opportunities.
Tanin needs to have great confidence in expressing his ideas in a group setting
"Tarlan is very young and lacks experience in the work place, but has a great deal of potential to be an excellent leader"
Taylor was not in a leadership role and so this competency was least used.
tends to work quietly alone
"Teresa established herself as a leader very quickly during her time at the Watt Family Innovation Center. She was able to take the lead on projects and became someone I could rely on to quickly and efficiently finish tasks. She also was able to help teach younger interns about software programs we use while designing projects, which I think helped strengthen her leadership skills. She's not afraid to take on a diverse range of projects, from photography, to videography, to designing major pieces for our exterior light display. In helping teach younger interns, she has also gained delegation skills that further sharpen her leadership qualities. Frankly, I wish every student was as capable and reliable as Teresa. I know her technical skills and ability to collaborate with others will aid in her success wherever she works in the future."
That is something that comes with experience in the actual work environment.
"The intern demonstrated basic leadership skills. He has been assigned greater responsibility for next semester, and hopefully he will develop the leadership skills with some more experience."
The intern has been on a good learning curve in all the other areas along with leadership but has to take more responsibility and need more team involvement in order to contribute to the growth of his organization.
"The intern who is a good team player, while needs more improvement in motivating the team."
The internship did not offer leadership opportunities so I did not get to assess Abby's leadership skills.
The internship did not provide an opportunity for Katrina to lead others so I am unaware of her leadership skills.
The internship did not provide an opportunity for Vanessa to lead others so I am unaware of her leadership skills.
"The only reason I suggest Leadership is because I didn't have an appropriate amount of time to measure Jake's leadership. He showed great ability to take ownership and lead his team, but the project he was on didn't require a larger level of leadership."
"The options to actually apply Leadership skills were limited in the scope of the internship, however I see this area as one that he could benefit the most to optimize efficiency in his work."
"There was not an opportunity to fully test these skills, but that is generally an area where improvements can be made. Specifically, utilizing other team members to achieve the goals of the project is an important area for growth."
There were not many opportunities for Ameya to show leadership skills due to the nature of his role. He may have good leadership skills but it was not necessary for his internship role.
"There weren't tons of broader leadership opportunities with this internship, but even on a smaller scale Savannah seems more comfortable being given instruction or processing certain tasks collaboratively instead of taking initiative. In some cases this works very well, but I'd like to see her feel more comfortable and confident about taking initiative and being instigative. But then again, this was Savannah's last semester at Clemson so she probably processed her internship differently than she would have if she were a sophomore or junior, e.g. had a lot of other things on her mind! :-)"
This intern position does not have much opportunity for the student to exercise her leadership.
"This is a difficult question as we found Skyler to be a very confident and competent young man, though this was the one area due to the nature of the work he undertook that he couldn't display this competency to any great amount. So would suggest if future internship opportunities arise maybe a Leadership role would assist."
"This is an area he'll grow inevitably as he develops in his professional career, just needs more experience which will come with time."
"This is an area where everyone can grow. Leadership is challenging. She did a great job, but practice will make her more confident."
"This is by far not a negative. Leadership is an area of consistent growth for everyone. Expecting that a college student would be at masterful level of leadership requires much experience with diverse individuals and the ability to know and manage others strengths and weaknesses. I note this as the greatest area for improvement not because they student does not exemplify the competency well, but because leadership is a life long journey."
"This is difficult as I think Deepak is a well-rounded individual. I did not notice any specific area the he needed special attention of improvement. I specifically chode ""leadership"" as this project did not afford traditional leadership, so his skills in this area were not as visible as those in other areas."
"This is hard because Becca possesses all of these skills. Her ability to lead and understand what is needed in a situation is remarkable. She is a born leader once she is given the tools to succeed. She needs to understand what is being asked and how to do the task, once that is understood she can easily do anything you ask her and go above and beyond."
This is hard because she doesn't really have a weak area. Eileen could work more at leading others. Her comfort zone is working by herself.
"This is just a hard area for an intern to work on because they are generally the ""low man on the totem pole."" As Ally's career progresses, I have no doubt she will be able to pull from her experiences as a student-athlete and business professional to become a great leader."
This is just because she wasn't really a project lead this semester so I wasn't able to see her leadership skills.
This is mainly due to experience level and opportunities to grow leadership. I've started to see developments on this front recently assisting in training for new hires. This will come with time and experience.
"This is not something she is able to do a lot in this position, but in the future maybe working more closely with the other interns and GAs in the office she could take the lead on a social media campaign"
"This is partially because we don't give her the opportunity to ""lead"" others in our office, although she does a fantastic job of taking the ""lead"" on entire projects. I do think that she might benefit from thinking about the ""why"" behind the student video features we do in addition to getting them done. Her work is excellent, but stepping back from it to see how each of these features or stories we tell fits into our overall strategy as an office would benefit her. Once again, this is partially our office's fault for not explaining these things and more clearly articulating our vision, but I think someone can easily get burned out in a role if they approach it in a way that is too workmanlike. If you're just completing tasks to get them done instead of seeing how they contribute to a greater mission, it's not hard to see why you would lose interest or burn out."
This is what we would expect. It's difficult to lead while learning a new skill.
"This isn't an area we were able to offer experience in but we have no doubts that Lane will become, should she wish, a fair and successful leader."
"This isn't truly a problem, but I will encourage her to show leadership in making suggestions and volunteering ideas."
"This may already be an area that Chris excels at, but it wasn't a skill he leveraged during his internship at NCR. Either way, it is a valuable skill for any professional to have and would be worth investing time in improving."
"This may be only my perception, since I was not close with Shahab 8hrs a day, but I feel he could learn new things faster or solve problems more efficiently by brainstorming with colleagues and formulating rough ideas to others and receive feedback or alternate approaches."
This one is difficult - only improvement might be to communicate better with questions. Hard to say because I feel Anna is already good at this.
"This past semester John was ""learning the ropes"", but in the future he will be expected to lead new recruits and pass his knowledge and experience to them."
"This past semester, she didn't have many opportunities to show leadership as she did last semester, but I still feel that she is strong in this area overall."
"This position did not require Sydney to undertake a leadership role, so I did not see her in that capacity very often. I think though, as she gains more experience, she will be an effective leader, as she is a critical thinker who is able to prioritize her work and meet deadlines."
"This role does not give him traditional forms of leadership. While is a leader in our social media plan, he doesn't have the opportunity to lead people or large projects."
"This semester I gave Jillian several opportunities to lead projects and make them her own, rather than having her do tasks for me related to these projects - she was very successful at this."
"This semester we didn't really provide Cole with the opportunity to demonstrate his leadership skills. However, Cole has now been voted the VP for the Makerspace."
"This semester, Ashley has really shown growth in the area of Leadership. She gone beyond collaboration to help guide and lead her fellow interns in the writing and editing process."
"This should not be seen as a knock on Ally. This position just doesn't lend itself to really leading others. However, I feel very strongly that Ally will be a great leader as her career progresses."
"This should not be seen as a knock on Dani's ability, but more a reflection on her experience. As her full-time career grows, I have no doubt that she will become a great leader. However, as an intern, this was an area that she wasn't able to work on as directly as the other areas."
This student has been highly proactive in coordinating work with his mentor and other collaborators for carrying out excellent research work.
This student may have great leadership but his position didn't give him a stage to show it.
"This was a tough question to answer, as Sneha excelled in all of these categories. Furthermore, her leadership skills were not strenuously tested during this internship. One of Sneha's tasks was to work with another undergraduate level intern, and she sufficiently helped and guided him whenever he approached her with specific questions. I think she will grow into a more proactive leader when given more leadership tasks."
This will be derived from experience as Lili continues to grow.
"Thomas is reserved and can easily get lost in the crowd if he is not held accountable or challenged on a regular basis. Knowing this, it was necessary to remain in close communication with Thomas to ensure that he was doing ok and being challenged and supported."
"Though it is more difficult for the intern to excel at leadership, I would like to see him become more self motivated to take on specific task within the office."
"Tiffani is a great leader, but as many of my other mentors she could use more practice in her leadership skills. She has great ideas, and with more leadership skills she will be able to bring more of her ideas to reality."
Tiffany is truly autonomous and takes initiative in her work to make it the best!
"To be honest, she is most likely all of the above competencies. She did really excel in her leadership this semester as a returning intern. She took projects such as the Clemson Students account to the next level and she helped our newest intern out tremendously."
"Tony has been an incredible individual to work with because of his personable nature and his kind spirit. He loves people very well and cares for others and their wellbeing. If there is anything that Tony can do or improve to make things easier for his coworkers or supervisors, he is more than ready and willing to do so.Tony also strives for excellence personally. While sometimes he lacks attention to detail, he is quick to assume responsibility for his mistakes and strives to be a better employee and person every day.Lastly, Tony is an excellent leader of groups and volunteers. He is engaging and manages groups well to keep them on task and also create innovative and fun ways for groups to engage in tasks as well. He is good at keeping a list of tasks in his head that always need to be accomplish and then finds and manages the right people to complete the task. Very consistent in getting tasks done punctually, high quality of work done, and strong desire to to do a good job"
"Tre' is a great mentor, he has helped his mentee develope great study habits and learn to find their nitch on how to studey. His past mentees and present mentees still come to him for help and advice."
Tre is a PEER mentor in his sophmore year of college and doing an amazing job of leading his mentees.
Trina has a strength in her analytical skills. She is able to see what may or may not be working in a situation and creatively think of ways to improve the situation. She can problem solve quickly.
"Tykia is now in her second semester with us and her skill sets are such that she is ready to lead and train her colleagues. Though she did not have many opportunities to demonstrate her leadership skills, she will in future rotations."
Tyler was ble to get his metors involved in campus activities and other oganizations through his leadership abilities
"Unlike academia where much work is independent in nature, in industry, engineers work as a team in a very fast-paced environment. Qing is a good team player, but he needs to work on timely and complete execution of tasks for his role in the team. I would often find he had work completed but wanted to get something else done too before handing off what he completed to another teammate. This reduces agility and makes teammates wonder why things are taking so long (when in fact they've been done). But, this is something that is learned over time. Qing and I have spoken about it, and he's working to improve upon this."
Using the whole team as his resource would help Shahab grow more
Very good at getting the groups started on projects without being asked.
"very knowledgeable and could be a great leader, just needs the opportunity"
Very self motivated and took on projects with little or no supervision. Always willing to help and learn as much as possible about the job and the expectations.
Very strong leader of the body-in-white team; excellent technical depth; leads by example and is recognized as an authority by the entire team
"very timid at times, stays to self"
Victoria had lead the school book project for three semesters. She has managed this project with a team of two other interns and done a great job of setting a vision and executing the vision.
Victoria had to make decisions - many times on the fly. She was always thoughtful and deliberate about the process.
Victoria has leadership skills but could continue to strengthen her ability to utilize the strengths of all of those in the group surrounding her as she moves forward in her degree and towards graduation.
"Vinay can, at times, come across as soft spoken. When leading a group it is helpful to project one's voice and show some confidence. This most likely is due to the fact that he is only here for a short time and had a limited role. I do think he does have very good leadership skills and would flourish in an environment where he is given more opportunities to lead."
Wasn't given many opportunities to show this so we hope to do that in the spring!
We can expect the student to develop more leadership skills as he advances in his study and career.
"We welcome Liyang's involvement and critical thinking in our healthcare projects. However, I believe Loyang is used to a more structured environment and is hesitant to put forth ideas on his own thinking out of respect for more senior members of the team. Liyang is a great thinker and we welcome his personal input on the projects at hand."
We were not able to put him in any leadership roles this semester but we expect he would be excellent in this area as well.
When addressing issues there are times Thomas needs to take more of a leadership role.
"Whereas I believe that Aditya can and will make a strong leader one day, unfortunately this position is not well suited to show off leadership skills. At this distribution center, the Inventory Department consists of just one person; the Inventory Manager, so there are no employees to lead. However, Aditya has performed well when called upon to direct employees involved in any day to day inventory functions and projects."
"While Hannah excelled in her contributions on our team, the internship role did not lend itself to a strong representation from the above listed LEADERSHIP competency. I can see her career benefitting from a boost in self-confidence in her knowledge and abilities going forward."
"While Sarah excelled in her contributions on our team, the internship role did not lend itself to a strong representation from the above listed LEADERSHIP competency. I can see her career benefitting from a boost in self-confidence in her own knowledge and abilities going forward."
"While she did show leadership skills in her work on several projects, I never really felt like she stepped up as a definitive leader during the course of production on projects. I think she still has some room to grow in terms of confidence with the process and will be given an opportunity to take the lead on a project to test and grow these skills."
"While there have not been that many opportunities for collaboration and working with others, our organization has various departments and experts. I would have liked to have seen Lucinda get to know and utilize those folks more deeply over her time here. I think this confidence and maturity will certainly come with time and I am not concerned at all that she will not develop this strength with a little more experience."
"While Tyler works well in a team, she can improve in taking the inititiave or a leadership role. She is becoming more familiar with our programs and events and hopefully will do so next semester."
"William likes to do things himself, instead of delegating. He could expand this by learning to lead others to do things they are capable of doing, which he has been working on."
William not only works with his mentees as a mentor but takes on other mentees and help them during study hall with Math and other homework.
worked solo
Worked solo most of the semester
Zach has great leadership skill as he has guided some of his past mentee with his leadership skills who are not mentors as well.
Zach has great leadership skills and displays them withhis mentors and with his fraternity
