"During one of our weekly fraud training meetings, the fraud prevention manager encouraged all the employees to continue to work hard to prevent passport fraud."
"I often times observed clinicians taking a leadership position. An example of this would be my boss, [name]. The first semester I worked this internship I worked underneath a different clinician. When this clinician left and took another job, there was a vacancy of who would be my new mentor. [Boss] stepped up to the role and she did an amazing job. This act of leadership taught me a lot about what it means to be a team letter and to be committed to your job."
"I was in charge of leading the renovation budget project. I brought the team together and determined who would be in charge of what improvements. I had them give me updates on how their part was going and then at the end, we all sat down and put together the budget. It was very effective and efficient and it allowed to be a leader and learn how to delegate."
Lead a project in which I had to collaborate with people from different departments and had to report the progress to senior engineers on a bi-weekly basis
Working with my mentor I constantly would go back and forth with her collaborating on a variety of things. One example is an Alumni Newsletter I created. I motivated her to reach out to the University to get it published in the Echo and because of our joint efforts we accomplished it!
"During WISE Choice day, a day that showcase WISE and its offerings to senior highs school girls I felt that I was able to serve as a leader. I was able to show these girls that it is empowering to be a women in a STEM even though more likely than not you will be in the minority. I was able to show that with perseverance, determination, and ambition would can reach your goals and pursue the career of your dreams. I felt that through this experience I was able to make the positive and lasting effect in my position as a WISE mentor."

"(this is repeated from before, but also with the stipulation that throughout this whole process I performed the basic-level shifts to show how they *should* be done, providing an example to strive towards). When I started up as CPT, a bunch of SPOs were, basically, awful- sleeping in cars, not scanning all buildings, not meeting scan times, going inside, ect. This was at first due to lack of viewable scans (when we were transitioning between systems), but it continued afterwards once the norm of ""slacking"" was established. Changing that was difficult and took many tough conversations and arm-twisting (both for SGTs and LTs to watch for this, as well as with the offending SPOs). With our low numbers now and lack of scan checks with the move and issues for the past month beforehand, there was a danger that this slack-ness would return. I am happy to say it has not, which I think is attributable to a new norm of *quality* to the shifts done, even if we are low on SPOs."
"This semester, my main priority was to create a training program for future medical scribes that the Sullivan Center hires. I completed a program that had 8 modules for various educational areas that were required for obtaining an adequate understanding of the roles and responsibilities of a scribe. Additionally, I worked on creating templates within out electronic health record system for various illnesses so that the documentation process could be more thorough and standardized throughout the clinic. Therefore, I was a source that the center utilized for their providers to achieve their vision of having a uniform electronic healthcare system to improve efficiency and patient care."
"A design lead, I had the most knowledge and experience working with Adobe software. Because of this, I had to encourage my teammates to be vocal about their ideas while also teaching them about the possibilities of graphic design and the guidelines for an aesthetically-pleasing layout."
A fellow worker helped lead a census.
"A good example of leadership would be the agents in my office planning for the fair. We all sat down and came up with what each agent wanted to do at the fair. We had a group discussion about what each person thought they could do to help the other with their idea and delegated tasks that we could do to help each other. We could have just all done something on our own but instead we all helped each other with the planning, preparing, and running of each other's activity for the fair. Everyone helped each other and used their strengths to assist the others. It was a great example of how much better events can be when people contributed their strengths to achieve an overall goal."
"A large component of my internship involves empowering the girls in the program to love themselves and lead healthy, active lifestyles. At the beginning of each after-school meeting, the girls have a journal prompt that asks them to reflect on the previous lesson we discussed and then allowing them to share their thoughts. I believe this was an incredible way to me to analyze progress and present future topics that needed to be implemented again. From their journal reflections, I felt that I watched the girls grow more confident in themselves. Middle school girls commonly never discuss with friends or family some of the sensitive topics we go over. By sharing their thoughts, they were able to connect with each other and feel united by their feelings."
A lot of people come to my boss for advise and i picked up very good lessons from it
A lot of the time I liked to encourage the graphics team to continue to be creative and come up with brand new ideas and original graphics on behalf of the recruits we were targeting. We always were able to collaborate together as a team to create the best graphics for the recruits and football program.
A main project for the compliance department is to debate and interpret NCAA bylaws for the rest of the athletic department. I was frequently called upon to ask questions and offer opinions in these types of situations.
"A major objective of the company is to keep costs low, and reduce data clutter. Thus, keeping the same suppliers and avoiding unnecessarily adding new parts/vendors to the internal system is encouraged. One of my tasks was to size up and choose components from several manufacturers for the needs of our projects while adhering to these company goals"
"A major part of my internship required me to organize material and set-up meetings and discussions with our core team. During one of recent meetings, I served as the lead facilitator and engaged our team in discussions about expanding the nursing program and coordinating our course for next semester. Leading a meeting with senior professors in the nursing program was a unique and rewarding experience. I was able to showcase my organization and leadership skills."
A majority of the work we did was teamed based. It took multiple people working together to set up for 200+ people events.
"A new production line was being started for a valued customer at the production facility. I was trained to implement time studies as well as work instructions for the new line. My supervisor, made me and a team of people work on it on the same. Various decisions ranging from material planning, number of parts produced, scrap information as well as time taken to produce a single part were made by my supervisor along with a team of colleagues. It was a good experience for me. I also attended scrap meetings which took place with the COO of the plant. Scrap evaluation was done in those meetings."
A part of my supervisors job involves social media. I was able to bounce idea back and forth with her and another coworker about how to improve the content being put up on social media.
"A section of student patrol involves the locking of academic buildings on a schedule every night. In the recent months, training new people was becoming difficult because many of our trainers would take different paths which confused the trainee. I needed a standard way to train everyone so that it would be easier for the trainee's to remember, and therefore pass their certifications. My co-captain and I asked our lieutenants to think of a way of standardizing it, after multiple ideas being tossed around we landed on letting the Buildings Lieutenant video her route and post it to our collective google drive so that we could have standards set."
"A significant part of my position was to act as the President Business Ambassador. I brought together 16 student volunteers to aid with multiple events on-campus. We were successful in completing these events in a professional, efficient way. Together, we were able to provide incoming students with the knowledge and confidence they will need to be successful at Clemson."
A specific example is one of the interns asked about how it can encode and decode structures into a JSON object. When this happens I went over to the white board and we led a discussion where I drew and he was talking to walk himself through as I drew it out in order to make sure understanding was clear. I feel that this was an effective way to lead the group and teach some knew things.
A startup idea suggested had the potential to be modeled as a social entrepreneurial venture. This simple idea steamed to a valuable idea in which the underprivileged community members of large metropolitan cities may reap the benefit of the successful execution of the business.
A time that I helped employees express different opinions was when I went to a meeting with [name] where we met with the new Communications Director at Sikes hall and talked about her goals for the future and [name] and I had different ideas as to what should be done and we all worked together to express them in a productive way. I even helped lead the conversation when talking about the marketing strategy.
A time when I noticed a coworker who capitalized on the strengths of each individual was during a monthly meeting to discuss the progress of the research study. She methodically addressed each person on the research team to confirm that he or she was following through on job duties. She encouraged each person to focus on her strengths. Any weaknesses or challenges that a person faced were shared among group and suggestions were offered. Her leadership skills allowed for a meaningful meeting and for each member of the team to have a clear vision of upcoming tasks.
"Acted as an undergraduate teaching assistant to lead the classroom in discussion of new technologies in society, specifically in the health industry."
"After discussing how to lead workshops with my fellow interns, I shared the idea we came up with to go about them in a different, yet more effective, way."
"After losing the first mentor, both [name] and I had to step up and assume positions of leadership. We debated the best use of our time, the best design for a product, and possible solutions to problems we encountered."
"After our events were over, I gathered people in order to get feedback on the events. It was important for me to gain valuable feedback so that the events are even better next year."
"After several meetings, I persuaded my mentor to accept my idea and finally we ran a study which is designed by me."
"After the Entrepreneurship and Innovation Celebration, [name] and I presented our work and accomplishments throughout the semester to the Spiro Board, and described how we'd been leading the initiative to spread entrepreneurship more widely across the seven different colleges here on campus. We received very positive feedback and enthusiasm from this group of stakeholders to continue encouraging our efforts."
"Again, because of the division in work and many projects nearly complete in design, it was difficult to take leadership. I noticed the way work was distributed was based on where each of our strengths lied, with one being great with technical drawings and knowing the firm's standards, somebody else being strong with materials and attention to detail, and mine being able to make presentable work to appeal to clients. Because of this, work was divided up by who had the best strengths for a project and passed on when another's strength was required."
"Again, during our lean events, Lisa and I brought together large groups on people and had to get them to agree on a new process. We had to keep in mind the larger goals of the university and keep everyone aligned on what we wanted and how to achieve it moving forward."
"Again, on the elected board of the intern networking group, I helped facilitate meetings and provided guidance to enable the forward progress of group tasks."
"Again, teaching the MedEx students allowed me to expand on my leadership skills, show them what the mission of the program was, and assist them in working through this."
"Again, this takes me back to working on the workflows with the whole office. The majority of the office would sit in on these planning meetings and everyone would hash out their ideas and thoughts for the work flows and as we were putting together a step by step process. There were many times where we stopped and I, or someone else, would bring up an idea that made other people express their opinions on the process steps and what is the right order or if there should be steps added in."
"[Name] and I spent a lot of time working together, so it was very important to me that we both had our voices heard when creating something. Most specifically, we had the task of creating a powerpoint slide, and wanted to bring all of our ideas together to make something we could be proud of. Sharing that common goal helped us to be respectful of each other, and have a final product that incorporated elements contributed by both of us."
"Aligning group objectives with global objectives was one of my primary roles in my internship. I was working with teams who are working on a variety of projects to address needs in Haiti. In order to help them progress, I would often help them align their narrow objectives such as writing a literature review to why they are doing it. There was a constant need for relating small goals to global issues, particularly the global water crisis."
All interns will have meetings with the manager where every individual is allowed to express his/her views contributing to company's goal.
"All of the donors to the business school typically have one goal in mind: Building tomorrow's business leaders today. For one event we were managing, a special donor event held in Raleigh, NC, I was tasked with the job of calling several people to see if they were planning on attending. Some of the donors who answered the phone were short and choppy, quickly cutting me off to say ""I'm not donating any money."" I had to quickly deviate from my script and ensure them that I was not calling to solicit donations - merely see if they received their invitation and if they were able to attend the event. Some of the people who had been slightly rude at the beginning of the call, quickly agreed to attend the event!"
All of the leaders in my lab work with respect and good leadership skills. My boss delegated work to the people in the lab so that their strengths were utilized
"All the employees are supervisors are leaders every day here when they advise and talk to students. Same with communication, they know each student is different and they have to approach things differently every time. Some students are going to be fairly confident within themselves and know exactly what they want out of a study abroad experience, while others might need a little more encouragement to get out of their shell. They take the time to get to know students based on their personality and interests, and capitalize on them to find the program that is right for them. They do this day in and day out and they never get burned out or lose patience."
All the supervisors and mentors in Clemson Abroad do a really good job of relying on the interns and capitalizing on their strengths. In the Clemson Abroad the interns do real work and are utilized to make the office run and to get everything done.
"Almost every day I would discuss the daily routines with my fellow team members. We would correct any mistakes and develop better ways in mowing, blowing, and raking."
"Along with a talented, driven group of Clemson students, I am helping to create Clemson large-scale University hackathon. Fashioned in the style of MLH.io, CUhackit will be open to all students and will encourage team-oriented problem solving over the course of the 23-hour event. Knowing that this event is being planned, I approached my mentor, [mentor], about the possibility of our team partnering with CUhackit. I recognized that both organizations goals and interests aligned and had resources that synergize well. After approaching [mentor], I was able to secure resources that would advance CUhackit through the use of Guidebook. This was a win-win for both organizations."
"Although I usually complete intern tasks, and don't take a great leadership role in the office, I set a standard for myself to partner with and support the office as a servant leader by completing tasks to the best of my ability."
"Although I was not there for meetings about nutrition that were conducted with the various members of sports teams, I have observed my mentor capitalize on the different strengths and backgrounds of student athletes when having meetings regarding their nutrition. Athletes arrange to meet with my mentor to develop a nutrition plan that is unique to their body type and sport. Being able to adjust and compensate for the wants and needs of athletes as well as utilize their strengths and weaknesses is essential in these meetings."
"Although I'm the youngest, I have been working the longest. Therefore, there has been many instances where I have been look upon for guidance on what to do."
"Although this job did not have a specific leadership position, by taking initiative ,when I had no direction available, to complete an assignment would be an act of leadership to complete a common goal."
An example of a time I did this was during the project with the Continuing Medical Education (CME) office. We had a shared vision to provide CME credit to all attendees of the Research Education Series and I worked alongside them to ultimately achieve the goal.
"An example of this occurring on the job would be when one of my fellow interns was producing a piece that I knew needed to be redone. Here at Campus Banner we strive to produce quality over and over so that customers are content and return. As I saw this coworker compromising quality, I took it upon myself to make suggestions to redo the print. This is the way in which I showed leadership."
"As a department, we asked Guest Services associates what are some ways to improve the department from their perspective."
"As a director, I am forced to take the lead on all projects and do things that other may not want to do. I delegate work evenly and fairly in addition to taking responsibility for my whole team and their actions. This includes making sure my marketing team knows how important the work we are doing in Haiti is. Because my entire team was new this semester, I had to constantly work to help them understand the vision of CEDC and get everyone on the same page."
"As a forestry intern, our boss frequently gave us tasks to do on our own to help us learn. One thing we did was learn how to value timber stands. Once a tract is cruised, we have to take all the data and determine the value based on valuation trends and volumes. This can be a daunting task to do becuase there are so many variables involved. As ""quarterback"", I somewhat knew how to do some things, so I helped others do it as well so that we all learn the process. In the end, this internship is all about learning in order to be successful in our careers. Knowledge is the most empowering thing I've learned during this internship. I attend many professional conferences with professional foresters and I'm able to bring this up in conversation."
"As a group we are able to solve student problems however, we know which one of us should lead the discussion as they know more about the application than the rest of us or have had more experience dealing with a specific problem."
"As a intern, not so much leadership role."
"As a manager of the RV parking for football season at the Snow Family Outdoor Fitness and Wellness Center, I was a leader and had to keep everyone interested in parking (over 300 people) up-to-date and aware of what was happening. Since there was construction on the property, things worked differently than normal, and I had to guide those interested, and help answer questions about why the reservation process was so complex."
"As a member of the HR Engagement Committee, I encouraged others to take a well-rounded approach to getting to know there colleagues and giving back to the greater Clemson community. I led my team through a series of service projects that would benefit the entire HR office. For example, our food and toiletry drive was most successful as we worked together to determine a donation and pick up schedule."
"As a mentor, I am responsible for helping the freshman adjust to college life, set goals, and stay organized and responsible for their own education. I served as a conduit during registration and housing sign up for my mentees. I was able to listen to their goals and then apply them in a way that would help them, keep them on track, and eventually, achieve them during their time in college."
"As a merchandise associate for Disney, we are constantly reminded of our guest's high expectations and our dedication to courtesy. After working for a few weeks, I was able to take a class called 'Next Level Courtesy,' which outlined tools and techniques to provide exemplary service to each guest. This involves engaging with the guest to form a great first impression, discovering what makes each guest unique, recommending products that fit the guests need, and closing the interaction. For older cast members, this was a different method than they were previously using. Each cast member was able to express his/her concerns about these changes and their effectiveness. We were all able to learn from each other and take each input to form the best process."
"As a more experienced employee in the pressroom, I am often responsible for leading and encouraging in standards of practice so that we meet all of the Institute's goals and represent the Institute in the best way that we can."
"As a part of my internship, I was invited to give a presentation to the Spiro Advisory Board ahead of the annual Pitch Smackdown. This is a board of Clemson Alumni, professors, and other influential venture capitalists and angel investors with a vested interest in Clemson entrepreneurship. During my presentation, I established a rapport and sense of purpose behind my and Dr. Hannon's case study initiative focused on highlighting alumni entrepreneurship and encouraging student entrepreneurship."
As a part of the 'burst builds' and 'run at rates' the monitors would meet to document open issues and assign responsibility to different individuals/departments. Leadership from the operations manager played a big part in this.
"As a UPIC, I am a leader within the CI lab. I have given presentations on studies, helped other students create and implement their own studies, and communicated expectations and tasks needed to be done. I have also presented at Clemson's FOCI and plan to present at a Southeastern Psychological Association conference this spring to communicate the findings of a study that my group implemented."
"As a UPIC, I am also part of the Creative Inquiry that my mentor is in charge of. I serve as a leader in that group of students and help them with certain tasks"
As an Aspire intern I was also enrolled in the Aspire CI. The ending project for the CI was to produce a project proposal and present your research to the staff. We were assigned groups to complete the assignment with: as you know group projects are never easy. The members of my group could never agree or they would criticize the opinions that our group members shared. I had to be the neutral member in this situation in order for the group to make progress and be productive. I would often suggest ideas that would be a compromise for both of their ideas.
As an important auxiliary department of the university we made efforts on our social media platforms to promote the messages of other departments and organizations across campus in order to help the in their goals to communicate effectively with the students faculty and staff
As an instructor I was constantly having to encourage the older participants that this was beneficial and necessary for their health. They are very set in their ways so it took a lot of strength to stand to them and tell them how to make the lives they had already mastered better.
"As an intern at Clemson CAPS, I assist the broader organizational goals of the entire organization by promoting mental health awareness, and using my unique position as both Clemson student, and CAPS employee to promote the services we provide and assist in executing the long term goals of the organization. For example, I attended a Health Fair put on by Clemson where [name] and I handed out brochures of the various programs CAPS offers, and met with interested students to walk them through the process of requesting counseling and meeting with clinicians in CAPS."
As an intern I have sat in on many meetings taking meeting minutes and have had multiple opportunities to hear bosses and coworkers converse and respect one another while differing in opinions to eventually reach a common ground.
"As an intern in the development office, when I first started working there the onboarding process was very complicated and if you were not the meticulous it was easy to not learn necessary materials. I proposed to my boss that I take on a project to create an entire new intern manual from scratch. This manual would have everything from the confidentiality pledge to instructions how to communicate with donors and everything in between. At first she was reluctant to have a first-year intern handle such a large task, but was convinced when I showed her my rough draft plan and explained how I knew what would be best to go in the manual because of my experience going through onboarding as an intern. After agreeing to let me create this manual and new onboarding system, I worked to create a very thorough, robust, and informational new intern manual. I took feedback from the other interns and team members we worked with to create a one-inch thick binder that all the incoming interns will use to become an immersed member of the Development Team. When I showed my boss what I had created, she was impressed with the thoroughness of the information and suggested that I help train the interns for the following year."
"As an intern there wasn't a lot of opportunity for leadership but countless opportunity to learn from other leaders. My mentors were incredible. Not only was I learning from mentors such as those in video production, but I was learning from other people throughout the company. C3 had these lunches called intern lunches and at each lunch somebody very important and high up in the company would talk to all the interns. They were leaders in their fields and they were incredible at their jobs. They talked about where they got and how they got there and what it takes to do what they do and to become a leader."
"As an intern your are pretty much at the bottom of the food chain. Leadership at this level is personal responsibility. Making sure you are to work on time, doing more than you are asked, and keeping a good attitude is what is really important."
"As an intern, it was difficult to find leadership opportunities. But, I was lucky to fall under incredible leadership. My supervisor inspired and pushed for an entire rebranding for the company a few months before I started. This not only included the Marketing department but also the majority of the company would be experiencing major changes. But my supervisor saw it as a massive opportunity than a challenge and he took everyone's strengths and made a great work force to continuing to make it work. The company is still working through the changes but the way he lead and viewed everyone on the team is what created so much success."
"As being a seasoned intern with the Senate, the new interns often come to me with questions or asking for advice with their tasks."
As for mentioned in the previous competency of the project I had to execute as a leader for an afternoon while my supervisor was tied up with a deadline. I was able to encourage the team member who was helping us for the day and ask for her feedback and thoughts on the project. I was then able to share her ideas along with my own as we reported back to our supervisor with the updates on the project. This particular instance made me embrace the role of leader because I felt strongly about representing her thoughts as well as my own in a positive manner.
"As head of the community service committee, I wanted to collaborate on ideas to have a big project this semester. That is how we got to the idea of Habitat for humanity by getting my committee together to discuss ideas."
As I am still in the learning process I have not lead others in any large amounts. I have observed and learned from my mentor [mentor's] leadership skills. He helps keep colleagues on track by notifying them on problems and requesting periodic updates. He also presses 3rd party employees to meet deadlines and holds them accountable for not meeting them. (We had issues with programmers missing deadlines and switched to a different company)
"As I am working in a small company, we have a very interactive and friendly atmosphere. My seniors often discuss their project ideas with me and take my opinion into consideration. They also gave me the freedom to take my own decisions regarding certain graphic presentations even though they were probably different from their own style."
"As I briefly explained before, one of my more significant projects was to implement an embassy-wide security accountability system. After coordinating with the embassy in Amman, Jordan and our own IT department, we were able to get a beta-type system online. A huge part of this process was making sure that embassy employees knew what the system was and how to use it. To do this, I set up daily training sessions where employees could come and learn about the system and give their feedback. This required me to foster constructive dialogues about their viewpoints on the system and how we as an embassy could improve it."
As I mentioned before we recently hired two new SEC's and last semester we hired another new SEC so now that we have three new girls I am one of the most experienced so I am finding myself becoming a leader to them. I am also a leader when I plan events with our clients because we have to help them make decisions.
"As I mentioned in the collaboration section, there was another intern with whom I worked closely. At the beginning of the semester I had the opportunity to lead as I was given the responsibility to inform her of various things that were happening in our programs as well as teach her how to work our database that we use for participant data."
"As I mentioned in the earlier competency, I was able to sit in on a team meeting where everyone's challenge documents were discussed and assessed. I was able to observe how my supervisor was able to capitalize on the group member's strengths and help member's when they needed it. Some of the group member's needed ideas on how to assess the groups during their challenge so that they could decide on a winner. My supervisor was able to ask another group member to share their rubric so that they could come up with their own rubric for their challenges."
"As I said before, I led a team to install equipment in our factory. I had to discuss the results of the project to the manager over the project."
"As I was contributing them with their different works, I was clearly able to understand how the inter disciplinary team works together to complete their required task."
"As mentioned above with regards to groups coming down for trips, myself as an intern was in charge of two specific groups that dealt with WASH education and the Center of Excellence group. I had different meetings that I was a part of and also when just talking to the group themselves I had to take leadership because I had the expertise and knowledge of what truly will work in Haiti and what would be better conceptually. This did not mean that I was condescending to the groups, because all opinions are valid and all thoughts are valid, but I helped in guiding from large over scaled ideas/pathways for the projects to things that are more obtainable here in Haiti and back in Clemson."
"As mentioned above, I lead a project at my work place called Power BI dashboard creation which requires a joint effort from many engineers. Originally being my idea, very often I empower and motivate people to get tasks done."
"As mentioned before, writers, photographers, and copy editors worked together alongside me in order to reach the common goal of a finished UPIC magazine."
"As mentioned in the responsibilities , I was leading the Conversion projects that involved conversion of all dashboards developed in SAP into something visually attractive and user friendly using Microsoft Power BI. So all these dashboards that I had created were going to be outsourced to users and customers and I responsible initially presenting these dashboards to the executive and then to the stakeholders. It was a challenging task because , it was concerning the users and as we know each user has a different requirement . So coming up with something that satisfied everyone's need was difficult yet important."
"As mentioned previously, I served as the leader of a open discussion about our visibility. This was something I requested we talk about during the agenda for the meeting, and wanted to see all interns have a stake in."
"As mentioned, my work in leadership related with the intern project allowed me to work forward facing with many other individuals and help them coordinate efforts to ensure we had a great presentation."
"As mentors, we have weekly group meetings with all of the other mentors and [mentor]. During the meetings we always go through information of the week such as events coming up, information to pass along to our mentees, or a guest speaker. I input my opinion or provide insight on certain topics such as things pertaining to my major, Chemical Engineering. I am also one of the only two hispanic mentors so sometimes I have a different point of view on things and how we can help the hispanic mentees such as when we talked about DACA."
"As my immediate day-to-day supervisor would assign and divide tasks, he often assigned work that fit within my strengths or was just outside of my comfort level. In this way, I was able to gradually improve and expand my expertise."
As part of my internship I worked to get Collegiate 4-H reactivated here at Clemson. This meant working with and sharing ideas with my mentor and the other people involved in the process.
"As part of my internship, I need to make a presentation to discuss my work with other experts in the company that I am intern in it. There were a lot of experts people that encourage me and other interns in our projects to develop new approach based that is much appropriate for our projects."
"As part of observing the group therapy of Yoga for Wellness, I was able to participate in the group dynamic. I assisted clients in asking open questions and seeking support. While also following up with the counselor in charge about anything that I heard that she be aware of for individuals."
As part of our training our supervisor and department had representatives from Clemson SAGA (Sexuality and Gender Alliance) come in and speak with all of the mentors to share their experiences about their life and with coming out. This was training for us in order to be prepared if ever a mentee came to us to discuss anything related to this. I thought this showed great leadership as well as helped us to further open up our personal perspectives.
"As PhD student, I work on the project with different researchers and published papers as first author in top-level conference. In the company, I propose project plan and take action to full-fill the goals step by step. I report the progress to my manager on time to let him know how project goes."
"As president of the study abroad interns for my fourth and final semester, I definitely demonstrated leadership more than at any other point during my last three semesters. I was in charge of organizing and communicating with interns, connecting them for various events. For instance, I was able to further my leadership and group coordination skills by organizing interns for several meetings, event sign ups and even the end of semester dinner. I established and utilized programs including GroupMe and Doodle Poll to make this possible. I had to make many adjustments to these events in order to cater to the needs of the interns. In doing so, I helped to create a healthy and well-oiled work environment."
"As stated in the collaboration section, I feel as though I stepped up this semester and encouraged collaboration and participation from everyone"
"As team lead, it is important to recognize and capitalize on the unique strengths of team members in order to maximize effectiveness. I was able to do this by identifying individual skills and personalities in team members and encouraging them to apply them to their work for the betterment of the Pearce Center."

"As the intern who has worked here the longest, [name] has entrusted me with helping other interns to complete their assignments."
"As the intern with the most experience in the lab, I was seen in a slightly higher position than some other student workers simply because I had the most experience when dealing with the printing press or other workplace problems. On Fridays when many students would be working, after a press run I would informally gather everybody and discuss what tasks needed to be completed and each person would volunteer their wants or dislikes of tasks and we would all work together to delegate our to-do list to get the lab cleaned on time."
"As the UPIC intern and the president of the student org for FIRST, my duties for each would frequently combine. With that in mind, over the course of the semester, a lot of the events that FIRST held were planned by the student org, so being the intern helped the communication between the director and the student org. There were multiple meetings held, and I led them and made sure that everyone on the committee was able to voice their opinion, and that their point of view was discussed. Through these meetings, we were able to organize and implement multiple successful fundraisers, the retreat, and multiple social events to bring the students closer together."

Asking how others take off gears to see how much faster we can get it done by our selfs to work together to get more done rather than 2 people trying to take off 1 gear.
"At Campus Banner and Design, both design and printing are crucial to the success of the business. Although I stayed mostly in the production area (printing) throughout most of the internship. I was able to help other design interns when they needed advice when designing. I may have worked in production, but everyone was confident in my designing abilities and asked me for constructive criticism."
"At Campus Rec, I worked in the CRC room which was a room full of Campus Rec interns. When we were getting ready to announce the opening of Douthit, I asked the other interns on their opinion of the content I was creating and if there was and information missing. This lead to a discussion of other content that also needed to be improved."
"At Clemson, I worked on a persona project with my supervisor to create personas and examples of students that might apply to Clemson. We were the head of that project, and we invited many others in her department into a meeting to brainstorm and come up with ideas to describe the various personas. We kept notes and then I compiled and finalized the information after the meeting. That was a great experience for me, and I really enjoyed working with the group of people to come up with fun and creative ideas."
"At Disney there is a platform on our company page called ""Grape Soda"" which is an area where you can recognize other cast members for various strengths they show during the work day. I have received a few of these recognitions and have witnessed a coordinator writing them for other members of the work force recognizing them for strengths such as efficiency or respect. They are not required to send these in, but they do so we know that we are doing a good job at what we are doing."

"At my internship with CAPS I work with another intern. We would collaborate a lot of different projects. For the tabling event for October we had to come up with creative ways to raise awareness for domestic violence. Our mentor suggested we give out pens on library bridge; however, my coworker thought stickers would be better considering college students use them more often. I encouraged my coworker to tell our mentor that the stickers had a potential to be better for reaching students. She was hesitant because she didn't want to interfere with our mentors plans, but after encouraging her that it was a great idea she went to our mentor and told her. In the end we ended up using the stickers for our tabling event instead of pens."
"At of our first meeting of the semester we had to establish some new goals and determine what we wanted to focus on. Since my supervisor encourages us to be independent, the other intern and I were able to lead the conversation and express our ideas. We also listened to the ideas of the other people on our team and by the end of the meeting we felt confident in the goals we had established."
"At our last meeting of the semster, our site mentor asked each of the student interns what he could do for next semester to make us more able to do our jobs. As we gave him ideas, he wrote them down. I thought that this was an excellent way to lead a group, especially a group of people who are younger and who are just part-time interns. It made us feel that he was committed to helping us to succeed and that he was open to hearing our ideas."
"At SEA we say the mission statement each meeting and our organization is focused around one word and that's action. So, every meeting we have, we speak with the intent and leadership hoping that someone will take action."

"At the beginning of the project, our site mentor was called away to deal with other important projects he's maintaining across the world. As such, one of his newly patented graduate students elected to step in and help guide us with our individual projects. That act of selfless leadership was inspiring as it was helpful."
"At the beginning of this semester, I facilitated a conversation between my mentor, myself, and my fellow intern to discuss how our roles would change due to our reduced hours during the semester and how we could accomplish the increased needs due to do the upcoming football games."
At the conclusion of my internship I led the CCIT Visualization intern group in demonstrating virtual reality equipment in the Immersive Space to five groups of students in the Emerging Scholars program over three days.

"at the conscious college road tour town hall, we encouraged students to come up with ideas that could help make Clemson a more sustainable campus. we worked to develop an idea that everyone liked and everyone had a role in making it come to life."
"At the end of my project, I helped a few other graduate students in completion of their own. In the beginning each one sat down with me and we developed a schedule that best fits their needs on the projects as well as my needs as a student taking 10 credits of classes. They then carefully chose tasked I was most likely able to complete in the allotted time each day."
"At the end of November, my partner and I with a few members of the water team traveled to the village of Morne Michel where previous interns had worked and where CEDC is planning to work in the future. Due to the eighteen-month between the last set of interns and myself in May of this year, all information possessed by CEDC on Morne Michel was at least eighteen months old. I arranged for and organized our trip to the village to re-establish our connection with the community and to achieve the goals for the trip we'd set before we departed (including the completion of a land survey, gathering of GPS points of water sources of interest around the village, and retrieving test-able samples of this water for fecal coliforms.) Though pressed for time toward the end of our visit, we accomplished each of our objectives, compiled the information and reported to our site mentor and the group in Clemson working on the development plan for the village. CEDC has worked previously with a church in Columbia which has agreed to sponsor work in the village to whom after the information gathered has been further compiled with potential solutions will be presented."
"At the end of the semester, me and my coworker were asked to design coloring pages for all of the Tiger Media organizations. While my coworker was feeling discouraged because it was so close to final exams, but I came up with the idea to split up the assignment evenly so that neither of us felt overwhelmed. We were both in charge of four coloring pages, which made the task more achievable."
"At the farm, this is a heavy requirement. In order to clean out a lot of the now empty pens, especially in House 2, we had to pull together the staff members and take each of their ideas on how to efficiently clean the space. Usually, one would say to use the truck, while another would say to use the bobcat. In the end, we took the best parts of each of their ideas and used them to finish the project in a efficient and timely manner."
"Attended meeting with Clemson Creative Services and communicated to them what our composting operation was about, how we operate, and what we were looking for in a logo."
"Awareness: I observed a fellow intern (a girl) at CCPD recruit a group of motivated students to start their own Adobe training class by calling on a faculty member with expertise in the area. She realized there was a need for this type of training on campus and she did something about it! I am inspired by her determination and willingness to help others, as well as herself."
"Based on my research objective I formulated a set of methodologies and shared them with my mentor and fellow interns. They were supportive towards my ideas. At times my mentor could rely on me over a few technical issues when he could not manage time to work with the team due to his busy schedule, and gradually I became an active decision-maker in the specific project that responded well to my pre-defined methodologies."
"Because of my role as a manager, I set the example for my coworkers and staff members. They look to me for help whenever they need it ."

"Before the beginning of every semester, the CEDC Board of Directors takes a retreat to discuss goals for the semester as they align with the goals of our organization over all. This semester, I decided to break up this day of dialogue and planning into two parts: Strategic Planning and Semester Planning, and I broke up these sessions into two days. This allowed for us to have discussions about the organizational goals in 3,5, and 10 years from now as well as discuss big-picture opportunities. Then in the semester planning session, we were able to bring these long-term ideas into the perspective of what could be executed within a semester. As Program Director, I had to plan and conduct these meetings as well as facilitate discussion. I centered the dialogue around our mission statement and pushed for us to develop a revised vision statement that would help the organization move forward. Then, I helped the board direct their thoughts about the upcoming semester in light of what our long term goals were determined to be. Our organization works internationally and serves the specified needs of a rural community, so our objectives are global ones and often align perfectly with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. For this reason, I also made the efforts this semester to incorporate lessons about the SDGs into our Creative Inquiry course so that students could be knowledgeable about why we are doing the work that we are doing. Each project, each task must align with the mission statement, so it has been vital in all meetings and classes this semester to bring the group back to our mission statement. It is our foundation and keeps us grounded when other things may be changing. The drafted vision statement helped us choose a direction for the semester and for the near and long-term future."

Being a student mentor to my peers that come up with questions or problems and being a more experienced staff member within the studio has led me to growing my leadership capabilities.
"Being in charge of the graphics team, there were many instances where I was able to direct and lead members to achieve a vision I had if the task was delegated to them. There were many instances where I would be overwhelmed with large projects, but would effectively communicate the plan and vision with others so that they could create the graphics I needed."
"Being involved with many behind the scenes processes at CORE allowed me to see how effective leadership is implemented. My mentor, the CORE director, displayed a lot of leadership skills.

"Being the intern that has been here the longest, I often am face with questions from other interns on how processes go, what they should do, where they need to be, and so on. I don't mind this at all, I love where I work and I love helping the other interns as well."
"Both Basic and Intermediate, I observed my mentor giving advice and gratitude toward the other employee in charge of the graphic communications and I often had an input on the graphic as well."
Building a relationship is so important when you are housed with 9 others. Being able to communicate on a personal level and being comfortable enough to give different ideas to others around you can help you or others reach a higher goal than intended. One of the interns was stuck on how to fill up tanks because the pipes broke and the nearest place to fill them up was 7 miles away at the lab. After all talking about it and bouncing back ideas we finally were able to figure out an easier solution for her and were able to all go out there and help her on that day's project.
"By managing the Immersive Space, I am leading a team of 3 interns to accomplish our overall goals for progression of the space, as well on how to follow through with projects and assignments and collaborate with other parties across campus. A shared vision this semester was for increase in a community atmosphere where students not only visit our space once, but become familiar and return throughout the semester and become a member of our group, building bonds through technology. I created a plan to accomplish this at the beginning of the semester, and then conveyed this to my team, and by now we have officially accomplished our goals of increased awareness and space attendance, but also student retention."

"CAPS does a lot of group therapy which focuses on clients recognizing and using their strengths in order to alleviate symptoms of things like anxiety and depression. Although I cannot observe these sessions because of strict confidentiality rules, I have spoken to clinicians and have realized the benefits. These clinicians show tremendous leadership by leading a diverse group of students while they navigate issues that are often difficult to talk about. I have learned that these clinicians must remain calm and level headed and must be sensitive to the diverse backgrounds and needs of all clients. CAPS runs many therapy groups every week. They are successful because of the leadership shown by the clinicians and I know this is something I will bring into my future if I ever run therapy groups."
"Club Sports holds monthly meetings with the Club Sports Association which includes all club officers. In these meetings, we are able to give the teams updates that are relevant to them and we also get feedback from the teams that we use to improve the program. Sometimes during these meetings, topics come up that teams are sensitive to, like the proposed changes for Student Organizations or funding changes, that spike some debate. Since we work to provide as much opportunity for all the clubs, these meetings are really useful in hearing from the clubs and using their input as best as we can."

Discussing the future of the Littlejohn simulation with multiple stakeholders
"DPR's culture is the answer for this question. The company employees always consider each others perspective and does a lot of brain storming to come up with ideas or to solve any type of issues. I was never treated as an intern in this case. I always had the liberty to speak up for any situation and put in my ideas as well. This had always inspired me to get people who are new on the job - site, to communicate with others."
[Mentor] is an excellent leader and treats everyone with utmost respect
[Mentor] leading workshops
"[Mentor] has multiple undergraduate students, and each with a specific set of knowledge and skills. I observed her capitalize on my own strengths, with my minor being in computer science.

The same was for students with coding backgrounds, as well as fabrication backgrounds."
[Mentor] showed me how to read and understand material and then turn that information into questions.
"[Mentor] found ways to get me included in most, if not all of the current projects at Baruch.

Observing the attendees interest, my manager decided to go ahead with the team and bringing in people from various backgrounds including interns like me. The way people were encouraged and given the recognition made the team members want to work more on the topic and this was evident in the following meetings on this topic."

Through discussion we were able to made videos that are professional as well as emotional for Clemson's social media page."
"During multiple staff meetings, my supervisor would arrange teams to hold events. While organizing WISE Choice Day, my supervisor collaborated with multiple staff members in the department to complete the itinerary, arrange activities, and brainstorm ideas. What made the group successful was their sharing of a common goal, helping young women find their place in a STEAM field."
"During multiple times during the semester, I've seen [mentor] organize events for the PEER/WISE program in which minority students of all ages visited Clemson. These events brung awareness to the students about STEM majors, and how people who look like us are underrepresented in those majors."
"During my creation of marketing material for the Killam Fellowship program, I organized information sessions across campus for individual colleges.

"During my first few weeks of my internship I was still getting used to the lifestyle of working long days outdoors. The first time I met the owner of the farm, [name], he came and organized everyone to continue to work for a couple hours into the night. He was able to do this by reasoning with logic. The days were anywhere from 90-100 degrees while the nights dropping into the 70s. He led our small team to finish a subset fencing project before the excruciating heat the next day."
"During my group meetings, I would encourage a discussion between my mentees and I by asking them about their experiences with that topic of the week in order to help those who were less experienced learn."
"During my internship I acted as a liaison between the CTGA and Plant and Environmental Sciences undergraduate students to provide both with opportunities they otherwise would not have had. Because of my efforts, undergraduate students had the opportunity to present their research at a professional symposium to well-known scientists, and they also had the opportunity to volunteer at the symposium and attend the talks. The CTGA, which was hosting the committee, gained the help of volunteers through my efforts, and we had a successful event overall."
During my internship I saw my mentor ask another CCGT intern to review and test my workflows and documentation of those workflows. The reason he did this was because he recognized that this intern had previously worked on the project I had completed and knew his level of understanding of the workflows. My mentor knew he could provide valuable feedback on how to improve my workflows and make my documentation more non-technical friendly because he has done the same thing in the past.
During my internship I was able to connect with [mentor] the CORE graduate assistant who works directly with the recreation and education.

The way we had been doing it for a while wasn't working the way it was originally intended to we wanted to amend the way it was used for better results. Instead of the managerial staff leading the meeting, the foreman on each shift were asked to lead this particular meeting because they were the ""on the floor"" experts who used it every day. The managers and I still expressed our opinions, but they were able to guide us and teach us the way they thought the program should be implemented."
"During my internship, I was present at many meetings with different departments, such as housing and academic departments. During those meetings my mentor always asked for input from everyone at the table on how to solve problems related to the exchange students. One such occasion was a meeting with housing on getting students checked into housing after hours. My mentor's encouragement of discussion lead to a new way that exchange students can reach staff after hours - by using an internet messaging app instead of having to make an international call to the on-call RA."
"During my internship, I was responsible for attending committee meetings surrounding the revised common rule, and taking minutes and sending follow ups. Through this project, I was able to encourage the committee members to complete their respective tasks and bring the group together to work towards the common goals of preparing for the implementation of the common rule."
"During my internship, I witnessed my mentor motivating the lab group during one of our lab meetings."
"During my internship, one of the tasks I was assigned was to investigate 3D scanning physical objects and people so that was could interact with them in virtual reality. One of my fellow interns was aware of another organization on campus, the MakerSpace, that already had experience with this technology and could help us. I emailed back and forth with one of the interns of this space, and set up a meeting between our groups to discuss this technology. We shared ideas and discussed potential funding options, and now we have a creative inquiry for this Spring to finalize the selection of this hardware and procure it!"
"During my internship, our department had several meetings where we discussed payroll topics. As a new set of eyes, I was able to provide a different viewpoint to those who have certain opinions. For example, a group in our department were discussing a more improved way of pulling W-2s for tax season. It used to be hectic because there would be several lists and hands touching them, which would create confusion and backtracking. I was able to utilize my role as an intern by discussing my job in pulling W-2s. I gave them my input of what I think should have gone better, which spurred ideas and conclusions to solve our problem."
"During my internship, there were several group meetings with other staff members and students so we could get a good idea of how to best serve transfer students. During these meetings, we had great discussion about how we can involve transfer students on campus and make them feel like they have a home at Clemson. We all shared different viewpoints, but had the same common goal."
"During my internship, we had an issue with the chlorinator used to treat water in the village water system. For some unknown reason, the caps that allow the machine to be opened and closed for chlorine installation blew up in the middle of the night. This created a sort of panicked situation as we had to find a solution very quickly in order to allow the water to be treated before people would drink it. My fellow intern and I had to use resources that we had on hand in order to come up with a make shift chlorinator that would allow us to treat the water, and then we had to share this idea with the other members of our water team in Haiti. We spent time explaining our vision so that we could get it properly installed. In the end, it was a success and my mentor was very impressed with our work and asked me to write an article about what we had done. I published the article on LinkedIn where our program supporters were able to read it and give feedback. The article was very well received which made me feel really good about the work we had been able to do."
"During my internship, we have had a few ""team meetings"" in order to make sure everyone is on the right page. Everyone has been able to share their opinions on how the office has been running, offer suggestions for how to fix it, and go over the correct procedures. I have helped to faciliate these conversations."
"During my internship, we would have meetings to discuss marketing ideas for upcoming campaigns. We would each share our idea and then brainstorm off of them. I shared an idea I had and then took advice how to tweak it, and then completed it in time to post on the appropriate date."
"During my intership, I had the opportunity to work with a few other interns. While working together, I would continuously ask if they had any ideas or anything to contribute when it seemed to be quiet in the discussion."
"During my interview with [mentor], my site supervisor, campus banner and design photographer, and myself, all worked together to ask her questions that gave up information about her current position and framed it in a way that would display beautifully in the UPIC magazine."
"During my program, I suggested to top-level management on how to improve Disney's luggage transfer process that helped increase efficiency and ease for the guests electing to use the complimentary program."
"During my service trip, I played the role of facilitator by giving everybody on my trip a means to give back to the environment in our area. By the guests willingness to sign up, I would believe that they had a goal to help clean up the environment in our area. I was able to have everybody participate in activities to reach our collective goal and push toward CORE's goal of bettering the area that we visited."
"During my time as a PEER mentor, I have had regular group meetings. In these meetings, I have had to serve as a leader to push the students toward achieving some goal, such as acquiring the skills necessary to be successful in their courses."
"During my time as the wellness intern, I have been able to empower the students to achieve their vision of becoming overall 'well' while here at Clemson. I have been able to hold events where we are able to talk about fitness and health. I have had the opportunity to lead such an amazing group of students and empower them to work towards their goals throughout the year."
"During my time at Azalea Capital, we acquired a company after many months of work. This was extremely exciting and after a few days, we needed to communicate to shareholders about the recent transaction. Knowing that I had financial writing skills from previous summer internships and also working in the writing center, I stepped up and asked for the responsibility to create the first draft of the shareholder press release. After that went well, I was asked to write other important communications and transaction press releases to investors."
"During my time at work, I notice the operation's mentor developing the group of students under his leadership. He lets them know what work has to be done and then he works with them as well to ensure that the event for the next day runs smoothly. He treats his staff almost as equals."
"During my time here, my boss led my coworkers and I to the goal of achieving a recognized social media presence for the Conference Center and Inn."
"During my time in the accelerator, I worked alongside other UPIC interns and while discussing a recent problem, I lead the group in coming to a conclusion for how to fix it and also how to make sure everyone's option was represented."
"During my weekly 1 on 1 with my mentors, I helped to foster creative discussion across a variety of subjects. We all worked together as a collaborative force however I take pride in that I brought up a variety of ideas such as asking about other job fairs, and giving a list of things that I can work on next semester that would really benefit the center such as pop ins and collaboration with clubs and organizations."
During office meetings or Push notification meetings I would try to let others speak and listen to ideas for every person in the room.
"During one of our first group meetings our topic was how to study. I had a handout with a plethora of helpful information. Instead of just reading from the handout, I facilitated a discussion where everyone shared their favorite ways to study and the pros and cons of each."
"During one of our intern meetings, our supervisors told us that we were about one hundred students short of making the quota that had been set for students going abroad this summer, based off of last year's reports. We were given the task of coming up with ideas of how to get those last few students to apply to study abroad, and we as a group came up with various ""It's Not Too Late"" campaigns. My idea of handing out candies on Library Bridge inspired others to make food puns, like ""It's CRUNCH time,"" (attached to a Crunch bar), to be handed out to students. It was a fun way to inspire different forms of communication and different view points."
"During one of our regular project meetings, the project manager was providing update on the project progress and receiving feedback from the team. He was recognizing the strengths of each team member and knew exactly who has the strongest skills to overcome each hurdles they had encountered on their path to deliver the project to the customer."
During one of our team meetings I prompted the group to share their opinions of a collection system design I drafted in order to see from their points of view. This process helped me improve the design and ultimately helped achieve the common goal of completing the whole robot.
"During one project for my internship, I organized the collection of 1,000s of student's work into a portfolio for presentation. This required me to utilize communication and leadership to bring large groups of students together for work presentation."
"During our ""It's Not Too Late"" campaign, where we encouraged students they could still study abroad, I produced graphics for social media and was in charge of distributing to the other employees in the office and encouraging them to post on their personal social media to raise awareness for our campaign"
"During our hackathon project, since the project demanded expertise in frontend development( my current scope in the internship ), I could help complete the project in a week by expressing my views."
"During our intern meeting, I'd present new ideas in how to collect our data and then open it to our mentor and co-intern to discuss the pro's and con's of each option to help figure out if it was a viable option for our department."
During our meetings we discuss our ideas and go back and forth to listen to each other's thoughts and opinions. I always tried to encourage discussion with the audience during the presentations as well so I can understand how others are thinking as well as encourage others to share their opinions.
"During our preparation for the Celebrate Safely campaign, I was the one to originally draft the written content for each of the 3 sub categories with pictures and video. After completing this draft, I met with my mentor and another colleague to dissect each proposed piece of writing. At this point, I explained my reasoning for wording it the way I did, as well as worked with both of my colleagues to revise and reword certain sections in ways that appeased all of our opinions and views. Once we had all completed a product we all agreed on, we shared this final product and vision of the campaign with other organizations on campus."
"During our semester long project, the interns each had a different background and mindset in going about working on the presentation. I felt that it was necessary for us all to periodically discuss our progress and to look over each other's parts to ensure that all sides of the argument had been covered and to gain feedback from different viewpoints in order to strengthen the argument. We were able to meet a few times to talk over our respective parts and collectively tailor the information to our desired audience and take into account feedback from our peers."
During our weekly escalation meetings we would spend 1-2 hours arguing about which cost center would accept damaged parts because of a broken process. We sat down with the operation leads in Hall 50 to optimize our meetings as they never spend more than 30 minutes in escalation meetings. During one of the first meetings after this new process that my boss couldnt make I had to step in and explain this new process to the assembly line section leaders.
During our weekly group meetings mentees would often come to us saying that they can't handle a certain class because it was never their strongest area in high school (mostly heard this about english class). Most mentors including myself would often try to apply situations the student is already familiar with to whatever topic they had to write about in english and this helped them to realize that they already had most of the knowledge to complete their assignments.
During our weekly meetings I used to observe our supervisor gives the same amount of time and right to everyone in the team to express her/his thoughts about different topics and concerns. He never pushed his initial opinion and always applied positive aspects of the other members to form a more effective team.
During our weekly rec rides where I had volunteers assist me
"During our work org class, I lead our team to complete a project within the plant. I had a clear vision of what we were to accomplish and made sure that there was synergy within the group. Once the project was accomplished, we presented our findings to senior management."
During out monthly internship meetings I encouraged the group of interns to come up with several ways to fundraise for the Clemson Study Abroad Office. This was an open discussion that allowed others to express their opinions and develop a goal and plan for the semester.
"During planning for language classes, one of the programs at my internship, we sat down to discuss alternatives to how the programs are currently run and offered our different points of view to make sure the programs were as good as they could be. I noticed some things that could be improved and we discussed them with the head of that programming and were able to make a positive impact."
"During some of my group meetings with my mentees, I would get my mentees to talk about different ways they handle situations and provide each other with ways they can help each other achieve the same goal."
During some of my staged video sessions I had to be a leader and tell my actor were to be and what to to
"During STEM day, a day that showcased PEER/WISE and its offerings to middle school students I felt that I was able to serve as a leader. I was able to show these girls that it is empowering to be a women in a STEM even though more likely than not you will be in the minority. I was able to show that with perseverance, determination, and ambition would can reach your goals and pursue the career of your dreams. I felt that through this experience I was able to make the positive and lasting effect in my position as a WISE mentor."
"During team meetings, I lead discussions regarding communications and ways to make it better. I have always been a natural born leader."
"During team projects and around the work place, there is always a constant discussion to share points of view on issues and tasks. For example, for our team research project I proposed that we should discuss how we would want to document the computer vulnerabilities. Also lead a discussion to determine why hackers would want to exploit these vulnerabilities and how we could stop them with our available tools."
"During the AFP National Philanthropy Day 2017 I felt a sense of leadership as I was in charge of paying attention to the Run of Show script and advancing the slides as well as helping [name] set up the audio, video and monitors at the actual event. It felt great to be part of a team that was contributing to this event which incorporated over 300 philanthropists."
"During the C34, my coworker [name] really stepped up and took charge when others in the group may have let their work slide, and we ended up with a really positive outcome for the group as a whole, which everyone attributed to her excellent leadership."
During the course of my internship I managed to have a good communication with my supervisor in order to ensure a positive outcome for every project.
"During the course of my internship, I conducted a Root Cause Analysis of a machining equipment. I talked to the maintenance technicians who fixed the various issues on the machine , the line Engineer who designs the processes for the line, the Original Equipment Manufacturer who sold the machining equipment to ZF Transmissions to understand why certain aspects of the machine was designed the way it was. After zeroing in on a root cause, I had to assign an action plan to each party involved. Ex: to introduce steps of Preventive Maintenance to be conducted on the machine on a periodic basis to prevent the most common issues, to introduce Total Productive Maintenance steps for the operators to conduct on a daily basis as way to improve the productivity of the machine and to assign an action plan to the OEM to come in and train our Maintenance crew to improve their efficiency."
"During the course of my internship, there were many times where discussion was encouraged, especially during the pre-production phase of projects. We would discuss what the best way to shoot an event would be, and there would be discussion going many different ways however in the end we always agreed on the best way to approach the project."
"During the first week of my internship, I had the opportunity to sit in on a meeting with the entire Marketing Department of BSE Global. Despite having only been with the company for a week at the time, it was very evident that there was a totem pole power structure within the department, in which those with the most power and influence had the loudest voices. Then as power decreased, relevance and influence naturally decreased as well. In this specific meeting, the VP of Marketing largely lead the conversation, directing everyone below her by assigning each person individual tasks for the week and establishing the deadlines for the long term projects."
"During the group meetings that are near exams, I give my mentees advice for testing like how do study, how to deal with test anxiety, and I tell them to have a goal in mind when taking the exam, whether it's getting a certain letter grade or answering a specific type of question right. They usually meet their goals and if they don't, I work with them on how to achieve them next time."
"During the headshot shoot I gave each person their photo back after editing to double check that they were happy with the photo. I thought a lot of them were excellent, but a lot of people did not agree and felt their photos were not that great."
"During the intern meeting, I suggested that we should do a postcard campaign to try to increase student yield. My group members loved the idea so now we were left with the task of trying to figure out who was going to complete what tasks."
"During the internship I was always eager to get those around me engaged in conversation. While working with the other interns and student workers within the Dean's office, I always attempted to create an open environment between us to discuss various topics related to our own lives, marketing in general, and projects we were working on."
"During the internship I was always eager to get those around me engaged in conversation. While working with the other interns and student workers within the Dean's office, I always attempted to create an open environment between us to discuss various topics related to our own lives, marketing in general, and projects we were working on. I was also able to help train our new intern to learn the ins and outs of football season."
"During the internship I was helping out with the CI class, the students had to develop a final product for the end of the semester. My mentor gave clear guidelines and assistance to the students to help them achieve the end goal."
"During the internship, we also have another event called hackathon, which is a one-day programming with a team to design a product or a prototype. In this event we all express different points of view to make the algorithm more accurate."
"During the internship, we had monthly department meeting chaired by our department manager. In the meeting, the department supervisor would first summarize the accomplishments of the department during the previous month. Then, he would encourage colleagues to give their comments on the department or other employee in a very friendly atmosphere. I felt that the meeting went out very successful. The supervisor always made it sound so encouraging when he was summarizing the accomplishments of the department. After the meeting, he also talks to someone individually, in order to get to know the people more deeply. He also tried to come up with suggestions or plans to help employees to become more successful in their career."
"During the last month of my internship, a marketing assistant was hired to help in the marketing department since the Director of Marketing left in early February. When she started, I noticed my boss had a sit down meeting with us to bounce ideas off of each other. [Name] (the marketing assistant) had worked at a different arena in Rhode Island and had a unique perspective to offer on ideas that we would not have had without her."
"during the monthly progress meetings, where only the project managers speak and give inputs generally, but i gave myself an opportunity where i gave my inputs during the meeting"
"During the planning of the FIRST retreat to Asbury Hills, we had a meeting beforehand to finalize all details and make sure that we did not forget anything. I led most of that meeting and encouraged the other peer leaders within FIRST to help brainstorm so that the retreat would be a success."
"During the same situation above, I was tasked as the leader for this group and had to make sure my team stayed motivated for the project. In the end we had a final product that we were all proud of and I was able to present this work to meet the expectations of the senior employees at the OISP."
During the semester I trained new interns on fundamental tasks around the office. I showed an intern how we file important documents because the filing is done strategically and then I left her with the task to go complete another project I was working on. We both then communicated to our supervisor that the filing had been completed.
"During the semester, we all had to work on parts of aspire. Through being a staff member, each of us learned to help one another out in the role of a staff member, as we Also encouraged one another to do well in their roll as a mentor/staff member and student."
"During the semester, we held a tabling event, basically a Health Fair. This is where we were able to talk to people from all over campus and tell them about Healthy Campus and what Aspire does. We also were able to promote safe sex, and overall well being."
"During the Sewer Testing We delt with some blockage in the pipe. Instead of failing the pipe section, we communicated together that flushing the system could possibly solve the issue. Luckily it did just that."
"During the summer scholars week, I was assigned a group of students to take through the facility and teach. Some of the experiments we had them do involved analyzing different samples to find certain qualities and characteristics. To keep the students involved, I had them do it themselves after being taught how the instruments worked. I had my group discuss ways to find what they were looking for on the sample and then figure out which one worked faster than the others. Seeing them throw out different ideas and discuss the pros and cons of each to determine which one would work best showed me that I had chosen an effective route to introduce them to the kind of research that is done in the facility."
"During the summer, I had the experience of teaching a group of food service workers in Anderson County nutrition basics while they were at a cooking camp. I saw them learn, share their stories and assessed them in their knowledge that led to an increased group knowledge of nutrition and the passion to serve children the most nutritious food as possible."
"During the team meetings, I saw the staff bounce of the strengths of each other constantly. I also saw it in the UPIC office and in my relationship with [mentor]. [Mentor] always made sure recognize my strengths and give me encouragement about my work."
"During the UPIC Magazine Project, I helped put together the idea of having specific jobs for each person on the project, like me being the head reporter position."
"During the Utilization data collection my mentor, [mentor], had to organize all of the interns into time slots so that the data could be collected around each interns class time schedule. This leadership helped the data collection be split as evenly as possible between the interns and herself, and also allowed the data to be collected in a reasonable time manner."
"During the weekends, it is very easy for the counselors to get tired and want to just watch campers do the activities. It was my responsibility to remind/encourage them to participate and engage with their campers throughout the entire weekend."
During the weekly meetings between interns and our supervisor I had the chance to discuss different solutions for the projects I was working on. I found the other individuals' feedbacks extremely constructive and helpful.
During training we encourage the new hires to ask questions and we open up a space for them to express any concern they have about anything. We tell them that we value all they have to say
"During Transfer Appreciation Week, a lot of the transfer students would stay at the events, but not know what to talk about or how to start a conversation with a fellow transfer student. I would help facilitate these conversations and partake in them as I am a transfer student myself."
"During weekly group meetings, I would sometimes sense that some of our team members weren't happy with how certain articles were coming along. I would ask them their opinions on these things, so they could feel freer to open up about their ideas. This caused use to be able to openly discuss the magazine as a whole, and let the writers have a say in the design, and the designers even have a say in how some of the articles were written. Our common goal is the complete the magazine and make it the best it can be, and I think these discussions helped us achieve that."
"During weekly lab meetings, my lab mates and [mentor] would sit with me and we would bounce ideas, problems, and solutions, off of one another so that we could see the problems from all angles. A few times it was my idea that was the solution and it led to making an advancement in lab protocol and in the project itself."
During WOW Jr. I had to encourage the students to form answers on the topics we discussed to ensure they were actively learning.
Each intern regularly rotated into a leadership position where we were expected to share our own experience with the work we were doing in a way that could benefit the work of the other interns.
"Each member of the SAD team is in their respective position because their talents and passions are being capitalized on. The three ""sections"" of the department are each ran by directors that have been trained and educated about service, inclusion, or leadership development."
"Each morning, my supervisor would write out a task for each worker on a white board. He would set a few workers in groups together and would write down the job to be done. Details of the task would also be written down, so we could always refer back to the white board or call our supervisor if we had any questions."
Each semester our mentor helps us each develop individual learning goals and uses each of these together alongside our individual strengths to make the pressroom operate more smoothly.
Each semester we are required to lead our team meeting in discussion where we assign articles to read and give a presentation to the group.
"Each Thursday my mentor and his boss have a meeting to discuss current projects and future strategy. Each time, I try to bring forth ideas and open them up for discussion to see what [name] and [another name] think, and to come up with the best solution for what we're trying to plan or solve."
"Each week at our Internship we have a weekly discussion in which talk about our accomplishments for the week and what we are struggling with, when someone brought up a difficulty I proposed a different perspective on the task which sometimes allowed for completion of the task."
"Each week I attended a meeting with the social media team where we planned the social media postings for the upcoming week(s). When there was a project that was very photo heavy, I took the lead on it and worked with other departments (video, social media, writing) to produce the best possible content for the social media team."
"Each week one of the coaches comes in to give his idea for the graphic that will go on that week's game plan. He evaluates the team's performance at the game the weekend before and evaluates the strengths in our opponent and creates a theme to empower the team. While we produce the graphic image of the phrase, theme, or idea, he enstills it in the players. Going into Senior Night and Military Appreciation Week, his theme was ""Band of Brothers"" and encouraging teamwork and encouragement throughout the team. Seeing the coach use a single phrase to lead the team to an overall goal for that week was excellent observation of accomplishing a shared goal."
Each week we have an event team meeting where everyone in our department who works directly with clients or events comes together and we talk about ways to make our events work fully as the client expects it to and how to make it work in the most efficient way for our staff. We all really challenge each other and everyone talks and thinks outside the box.
"Earlier, in the semester, a guest speaker came to Clemson and two of my fellow interns and I had to produce two highlight videos about it for the Clemson social media channels. Before we went there, I made sure we got together to think of a game plan for how we wanted to handle the shoot."
Effectively delivered the cycle time optimization studies and standard work documents for the door lines of new generation car models by leading a team of interns and coordinating the work among them.
Emails again
"Enabled Haitian doctors, engineers, other stakeholders and student project group members to create a shared vision for the operating room redesign. Facilitated the presentation of the students design proposals to stakeholders."
[Name] showed a lot of leadership when we were hiring a new employee. One member in our department didn't agree and he sat down and talked with her multiple times to try to resolve issues.
Every day I worked with two other interns from other schools and coordinated our schedules and projects we were working on
"Every day our mentor would give us our tasks for the day, and she would base those tasks off of what was everyone's strengths."
"Every employee that works at Brevard's water plant has worked their for several years and multiple people are approaching retirement age. Overall, it seemed that everyone had a great deal of understanding for what their job entailed and the supervisor rarely had to tell them what to do."
Every meeting there are decisions that need to be taken. Proposing ideas and listening to others suggestions is very important.
"Every Monday morning, I took part in meetings at the Trustee House where members of the social media team collaborated and brainstormed ideas for the coming week. We all had to lead discussions related to which events the University would cover that week and how we would cover them."
"Every Monday morning, the PEER&WISE coordinators have a group meeting in sharing details about passed events, future events, and things need to help the program prosper."
"Every Monday we would have meetings with the editors of the Clemson World Magazine and we would discuss what would be needed for the next issue. They were talking about getting photos from move-in, and as an RA, I had all the information about move-in and they asked me questions about dates and times, and I was able to tell them a plausible way to help them get the images they needed."
"Every month my department holds a ""Creative Hour"" where we break into groups of five and try and work through specific issues our department has brought up. Last month my group was tasked with looking for a way to establish standard assumptions when creating simulations. I brought up my experience formulating a simulation without these assumptions and opened up a conversation with a colleague who had not yet started hers. In the end I believe we reached some actionable conclusions and presented them to the rest of the department."
Every other week my department held a meeting with all the interns and our mentor to discuss what we've each individually been working on and what our goals are for the upcoming weeks. It was great to be able to share what I've been working on and receive feedback from the others about what needed to be fixed or improved upon.
"Every project that I've worked on has been a collaborative effort, and my mentor has done a very good job at recognizing peoples strengths and playing to them. Most notably was the development of the magnetically damped check valve, where valve experts worked with magnetic experts, machining experts and testing experts."
"Every semester we have an area meeting. We provide updates on our policies to our student workers. The previous meeting we had, we were able to ask for suggestions from the staff. This included feedback on our new training model. It really helped us develop our communication between workers."
"Every time I complete a design project, I send it to multiple people on the team and ask them if they have any thoughts on how it could be improved. After receiving feedback from my team, I send it to my client. I detail the changes I've made or I detail my design project, and I ask for a second level of feedback. Through this process, I receive a lot of different feedback to make the best product possible."
"Every time we work we work under other employees at ITC. Every day i see these employees assign different interns to different tasks so that all the tasks are completed on time. Interns with more software experience are assigned to the software portion of fixing the servers, where as those with more hardware knowledge are assigned to the hardware side."
"Every week for my internship, we met as a team and talked about our different projects. My mentor led the meeting every week and did a great job about speaking to each of us about our specific projects while tying our projects in to everyone else's bringing everyone closer together."
"Every week my fellow interns and I would host ""Be Brilliant"" workshops. These were designed to help Bridge students adapt to college and learn how to be academically successful. We covered many topics such as test anxiety, time management, connecting to Clemson, and stress relief, to name a few. As a leader, I had to empower students to be successful during their bridge year in order to reach their goal of bridging to Clemson next fall."
Every week my lab group has a lab meeting and the primary investigator (lab leader/director/my mentor) asks everyone in our group of about 15 people to update all of us on their work and asks what their future directions are and provided suggestions and advice to aid them in their work. He also helped make connections by providing useful contacts to everyone in the group to help further their work and by drawing connections between the different members of the group.
"Every week we would have meetings to discuss updates on the Makerspace operations but also ideas and solutions to making the Makerspace operate more efficiently. We would all propose ideas to improve the space and as a group we would decide if it would be a effective solution to our problem. If it was, a committee would be formed and the members of said committee would be responsible for executing the solution. One of our ideas was to incorporate small bags for several small 3d printed parts so that they don't get lost and/or missing."
"Every week when my mentor informed me what I was to work on during the week, I saw my mentor exhibiting these leadership skills."
"Every week, all of the members of the lab would gather for a lab meeting in which the lab members would share the data they had gathered and ask each other for advice and share information. During each of these labs, [mentor] would always encourage everyone to speak up and say whatever was on their minds, and he always encouraged cooperation."
Everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses. During my internship I was consistently working with clients because the firm recognized that I have good social skills. Other interns specialized in other tasks that they were much better at than me. Every successful organization tailors employees assignments to their strengths.
"Everyone in the lab group is working on the same projects, but we all work on different sub projects. These individual assignments are assigned by my boss based on our strengths, technical expertise, and experience in the subject. He also made sure to ask me beforehand if I felt interested in this project, believing that I will do my best work if I actually like the work. He also understood that I am learning and often pointed me in a good starting direction. All this gave me confidence that I can successfully accomplish the task."
"Everyone in the lab is proficient in a certain area. Some of us are better at 3D modeling, while others are better at Illustrator. Because of this, [mentor] would split large projects into components and distribute them according to our strengths. He also often paired us together so that we can learn from each other. I learned 3D modeling because of this and others learned Arduino programming from me."
"Everyone of our workers has a certain strength that should be utilized to most efficiently perform our tasks. I organized the other interns on a phase implementation project to ensure the project was done quickly. 1 intern was set on labeling cables, 1 was set on running them, and 1 was set on implementing the hardware."
"For a booklet design, I got other peoples' opinions on some visual graphs and had them choose which was easiest to understand. This allowed me to hear many different opinions in order to reach the goal of finding the best visual representation of information."
"For a project that had some problems, we had some people who worked at Prettl Germany who specialized in PCBs and Electric components to help guide us and share their knowledge and expertise with us. This helped us answer most of our questions and solve our problems and gave us a better direction. We benefited from their strengths."
"For a social media campaign, I asked different individuals in the office what they were grateful for so we could showcase the real people behind Clemson Parking and Transportation Services."
"For both internships, I demonstrated leadership by being on time to work, showing progress and utilizing skills to execute projects"
For most the time I was responsible for closing the WATT center IT department. This involved a great deal of leadership since there was not ever a supervisor to watch over me. I had to quickly learn the functions of the building incase I was asked a question from someone.
"For my internship, I used leadership skills when I helped lead a meeting between two full-time members and another intern to go over my project and the next steps looking at the requirements of the task and draw out an agreed upon solution. For this meeting, we all shared our different ideas which were respected and discussed."
"For my mentees, I strove to be a leader and an example of a student who has been in their shoes and succeeded. Everyone comes into engineering with a different goal or reason but most students at the end of the day want to solve problems, help people, and enjoy doing it. I was able to communicate different resources, opportunities, and my own experiences to help them begin to achieve that goal at their time here at Clemson."
"For my project, I needed substantial help moving tanks and tubs, recording data, and filtering. I was working with idividuals who had their own projects to focus on, so I had to explain what I expected/needed and listened when we ran into obstacles. They needed to know I was grateful for their help and that they were doing a great job, and that their ideas were greatly appreciated and helped us move past any hiccups."
"For NPHC: Fall Fest Step Show, I had a meeting with my client and with a few people from our operations staff. I helped the client convey what type of tech he wanted for his event. I also helped the operations staff give input and have them collaborate to figure out the best way to proceed with the event. I then divided the jobs among our group so that we could get everything done efficiently based on each person's skills."
"For one of my data analysis projects, I created a tableau dashboard. I was required to highlight the use of the dashboard to some of the members of the business. To advertise the tool, I explained the benefit that the tool would reduce the amount of analysis my team members would have to do offline. Additionally, having all of the data in one place allows the entire business to be aligned instead of everyone pulling different reports."
For one small project we were working on we needed to install a new ice maker. The important inputs to an ice maker are electricity and water. We were trying to determine the best location for this ice maker in one of the labs so that we could easily access the water and electrical lines. I was able to give my 2 cents on where I believed we should install the ice maker based on the utilities that I could see.
"For part of my internship, I attended a meeting for planning the upcoming Clemson international festival. Many people from different backgrounds were present and talked about their many ongoing projects to better the festival."
"For the festivals I helped put together, I and others had to come up with ideas for things to hand out. I led the group in coming up with ideas for items, but also information related flyers to hand out. Everyone got to give their opinions and comments, and we came up with good ideas."
"For the festivals I helped with, we needed ideas for things to hand out and things to do at the festival for the everyone. I helped get a group of people together, many of whom were going to be at the festival helping, to discuss different ideas. I made sure everyone got a chance to give their different ideas and opinions on all the ideas stated. I also made sure that everyone was in agreement on the final ideas for the festival."
For the glue gun project I had to communicate with all the operators in each cell to take feedback for the staple gun. This helped me to understand the problem they face regularly and think about how to overcome them. This was the time where I encouraged discussion where individuals could share their point of view to achieve a common goal.
"For the intern project we were given, me and the other design intern were in charge of all the design work for the project which turned out being the majority of the final product. When it came to this part of the project, the other interns really turned toward us and let us take charge. Not only were we given the freedom to make all of our own ideas but a lot of the other facets of the project stemmed from our ideas. We allowed other interns to contribute to the collaboration of ideas and facilitated the process of making one cohesive project that incorporates all of our ideas."
"For the Lever Hall of Fame, all the other interns and staff met to discuss roles and what had to be done. During this meeting we were able to bring up and concerns or ideas to better the ceremony."
"For the [name] project, I gathered my team members together to discuss ideas surrounding the Book of Names and the spring event. After we met, I compiled our ideas into an email and updated [name] on our progress and shared our ideas with her."
"Frequently during this semester different individuals at my office would send emails to everyone in the office recognizing the achievements of other coworkers. One specific example was about 2 weeks ago when a coworker was promoted to a managerial position. A chain email was sent to everyone in the office and multiple coworkers responded congratulating the advancement and wishing the individual good luck, which represents the acknowledgement of achievements within the organization."
"From our daily meetings I observed [mentor] (my onsite supervisor). i have rarely seen a more approachable manager but he still conveys his point. On a lot of my previous teams i have observed people hiding problems, this was much open. I didn't have much leadership opportunities, as I was not managing anyone directly."
"From the beginning when I first joined the team at Madren Center, the supervisors encourage all of us to look towards our goal for the end of the semester. They encouraged all of us to challeneg ourselves and to not be afraid to ask questions."
Gave many class presentations to nursing students to help them understand how to use 3D printers and how these devices can empower them to make changes.
General support of others in the office in order to allow them to achieve their goals by contributing to projects in any way I could so that they would be successful
"Given the nature of my internship being team-based this semester, myself and my partner had a common goal of success. I already knew the expectations, processes and overall vision that was assigned to us, but my partner didn't. My first step was getting her onboard with the vision of what [mentor] expected from us and laying out a plan of how to get there over the semester."
"Got to show students how to use machinery and work with different kinds of tools. It was important to be knowledgeable about the machines in order to teach the,"
Had taken initiative to directly solve issues and deal with suppliers . will also additionally take more responsibilities.
[Name] and I would discuss app features. I would show him my research and tell him things I found interesting and he would give his opinion.
Have helped other interns in preparing for interviews and have encouraged/praised interns in their products and pushing it to the next stage.
Having to host auditions for Vagina Monologues and empower the group to successfully learn parts
Helped lead the creative inquiry class meetings that i am a part of when our grad student that normally leads was out of town.
Helped others on developing maps.
Helped student organizations leaders to plan events and create their vision of an event while encouraging them to make the event as inclusive for Clemson students as possible.
Helped the team brainstorm solutions to an organization problem.
Helping to guide other interns in an open forum with ideas for there own separate programing
Hosted several meetings to discuss and solve issues.
"I accompanied my internship supervisor, [mentor], to many different meetings for the Cattleman's association. [Mentor] is heavily involved with this association and often presents on various topics and helps organize their events. While I have been attending these meetings, It became clear to me that beef production techniques vary among every producer. Each individual has their own unique ways of doing things that range from rotational grazing to administering vaccines. I noticed that [mentor] spends a large amount of time talking with the producers involved in this association to gain a wide range of knowledge. He is very open to considering different methods of production and learning which techniques work best. A specific example that I observed comes from a local beef producer who is also a member of this association. Many of the producers from older generations are stuck in their ways when it comes to rotational grazing. This specific producer has used research and scientific evidence to develop his intensive grazing management practices in an effort to cut down on internal parasite populations. He feeds virtually no hay to his cows, unlike many of the other producers. By keeping his cows on pastures for usually less than a week and allowing the grass to maintain longer lengths, this producer has found a way to disrupt the life cycle of the parasites that often present issues beef cattle. The producer has consistently seen much lower populations of internal parasites after applying these methods of rotational grazing. I have observed [mentor] take this information and share it with others at the cattleman's association meetings, even going so far as to organize a meeting at this producer's farm to have him share his successful methods with others. [Mentor] recently purchased a few cows of his own and plans to use these new rotational grazing methods. This method is different from what he grew up doing at his father's beef farm. I believe this showcases his leadership and ability to capitalize and benefit from another's point of view."
"I acted on behalf of Clemson internal communications when determining how to frame a story about Tiger Advocates. I had to relay the ideas and limitations that internal communications had to the people working to publicized Tiger Advocates, and then had to work with them to craft the story."
I added a section to each week's meetings where interns could discuss any problems or ideas they've had about the space. This would allow us to share ideas and solutions to common problems.
I aligned the faculty of the SMCC to achieve the goal of future profitability by providing them with tools and resources to jumpstart their off campus consulting branch.
"I always asked questions that would lead to the best articles written with passion and knowledge, but one particular instance I was not getting as much of a response so I opened up the floor for more general discussion which then made the person more comfortable with my position as an intern to then share information."
I always try to take the lead on projects and I enjoy public speaking and leading the Aspire class in discussion.
I am able to communicate group accomplishments to the board of trustees indirectly by helping prepare quarterly updates from Lean team members.
I am able to lead others. If I am working on a task I am able to delegate responsibilities to others.
"I am accounts receivable analyst, and my lead is [mentor]. She devotes herself on everything about billing. She arrives at location at 6 a.m everyday, and leaves at 4pm. She answered our questions very specifically and in detail. She is a good lead at billing."
I am always observing [mentor] express leadership within his meetings. He always presents the issue with respect to those around the issue and/or those who could be impacted by it. He keeps a calm meeting room to promote solutions within the group.
"I am constantly watching [mentor] and [mentor], observing the way they interact with the mentors and everyone who enters the PEER/WISE office. I observe how [mentor] leads her office staff into a discussion of further enhancing the efforts of the PEER/WISE office resources and the staff."
I am currently in the process of training and communicating our goals as Inside Clemson to the new intern for next semester. I have also communicated with other current interns to establish one common voice throughout Clemson's media.
"I am not directly over any other employees. However, as a manger, I work with many employees in our department for each event. We are adding more people and changing some of our processes. If I see a problem with one of my events or if I notice that there is confusion about something, I try to make sure that it is addressed and fixed for next time."
"I am technically above over 8 people on the CEDC organization chart, which at one time would've scared me. Now, I feel comfortable delegating work and trusting my teammates, to the point where I am now taking on a large leadership role next semester as Assistant Program Director."
"I am the Assistant Program Director, it is my job to serve in assisting groups in determining objectives for the semester, and making sure that they are on task to meet their goals. Along with that I work with the other directors and make sure that project objectives are headed in the direction that will benefit the organization."
"I am the committee head of the community service committee in PEER/WISE. As one of the heads, we decided to come up with a list of events that we would want to do. To make sure that these got approved, we met up with the department head and communicated our ideas. We also worked with our committee so that they would help out with the project as well."
I am the main channel for the students to talk to about the study abroad program. I also run the Rosetta Stone programming so I am the point of contact with any issues about that.
I am the oldest of the interns and they all look to me to guide them when starting task and ask me to evaluate them upon completion.
"I am the senior intern for the facility, so it is my role to lead the other interns. I teach them all of the tasks they need to do and explain to them our goals at the facility so that we can all team up and try to reach them together."
I arrange the time for discussion and team-work measurement. We will argue on the encountering problem and try to find the supportive evidence to convince each other.
"I asked for my seniors' opinions about increasing work performance rate. In return, I gave my suggestions as to how wastage can be reduced."
I asked my fellow peers for feedback during our decision making so that we could make decisions that represented their interests
I asked my interns what they wish was different about the process and got feedback which was later implemented.
I assisted in leading the Business in Paris program since I had been on the program and had been the one in the office with the most experience relevant to it. I took on the role to focus on visa applications and as a guide before and during the orientation process in Paris.
"I assisted in organizing a knowledge college by brainstorming topic ideas, organization strategies, people to utilize and other details."
I assisted my supervisor in answering questions about how these technologies can be beneficial in nursing to groups of nursing students that came in the lab to experience the technologies for class.
I attended 2 meetings a month where I would meet with the whole instruction team about everything that was happening in Cooper Library. Everyone worked together to improve the service desk at Cooper Library and kept everyone updated on ideas and gave feedback. Everyone at Cooper Library treats others with respect.
"I attended Lenders School and I got to work with loan officers. I had the opportunity to share my opinion, work in groups, conduct hypothetical situations and case studies. The people that I spoke to had common goals and they spoke to me about their career path. It was interesting to me because I learned we had a lot of the same values and career paths. Others seemed to like my input during the case studies and it helped everyone to reach a shared goal for a particular case study or situation we were studying. I was told that I did well keeping up with the rest of the class by answering questions and collaborating."
"I attended the sustainability webinars that were presented during lunch hours. There were folks who were looking to get furthering education certificates there and some interesting discussion and proposals during this time. I was able to represent a younger demographic as well as one who has been studying sustainability in school. One idea I proposed was to plant trees for every business travel trip in an attempt to offset some of the carbon expenditure. Following this, I lead discussion on the ideas surrounding this proposal."
"I became well versed in making sure everyone was doing their tasks. To make sure everything was done every day, I had to step up and set a good example by rounding everyone up and getting them to do what was needed rather than slack off. This was hard at first, but after awhile it became easier to motivate others to do what was needed."
I believe I have an intermediate proficiency in leadership. A story that reflects this is my ability to lead in my sorority. I recently was elected as the Vice President of Marketing which allows me to create a marketing team that will help me throughout the year. Through this position I will have to lead 4 girls.
"I believe leadership relates to my Ramen advertising campaign example as well. This is because in order to ""sell"" my idea I had to communicate my vision to my mentor and other team members and get them on board with the project. This enabled me to empower others to achieve my vision by developing and implementing the project."
I believe that many times throughout my internship experience supervisors would recognize the strengths of different researchers. Often times my head supervisor [mentor] would see problems [name] and I would face with our research and she would point out people that had strengths in the areas we were struggling in so that we could reach out for help when needed.
"I believe this happens a lot with me and my boss, we ask each other's opinions, advice or views on different tasks. She will ask me about how to approach an issue with a colleague and I ask her advice on how to approach different tasks I'm given. We have a constant, respected flow of communication that helps us build and contribute to our common goals."
I came across a senior manager allocating the project to different people based on the strength in their areas.
I can give clear instructions to other that tell you how to complete a specific task.
I co-led the social media ambassador program where we had to facilitate a healthy discussion with the ambassadors about what we expected from them and what they wanted to learn from us. So that we could have healthy two-way communication.
I collaborated with other interns and their project for the purposes of storm-water management.
I communicated my ideas clearly to my colleagues from another division who were impressed to let me work on a project individually with minimal support from them.
I converse with many colleagues about an issue and we collaborate on an equal level to develop a solution.
"I co-planned Tigers Unite, another new student-athlete development program within Athletics. Tigers Unite's goal is to form a community with other student-athletes in hopes to create Tolerance, Inclusion, Growth, Equity, Respect, and Service within the Athletic Department. Tigers Unite is a place to create relationships with other multicultural organizations including Athlete Ally, International Student-Athlete Association, and the Minority Student-Athlete Association. By connecting different multicultural organizations, all the organizations benefit. It gives each organization more support, and creates broader organizational objectives outside of each individual organization. Ideally, Tigers Unite also influences and supports global objectives of making Clemson Athletics, Clemson University, and beyond, better."
"I created a kickstarter video for my company, kanga, which we were able to create and fully direct to tell a story. It took over a month of setting schedules and editing it appropriately."
I created the Career Fair worker schedule. I worked around each person's schedule and tried to place them at their desired role. Creating and communicating this schedule helped the fair run smoothly and ensured that we had enough help at each station.
"I currently serve as the president of my sorority, Kappa Alpha Theta, in this role I am the main point of contact for the other 23 officer roles. My daily goal is to make sure my organization is running smoothly and towards the widest influence for good. In order to make sure this is done successfully, I have to help all of our committees communicate with one another to make sure we are doing all we need to be doing, while helping others."
"I define leadership as an influence on the others around you. How I showed leadership this semester was always encouraging if someone doesn't know something, ask, so we can find that solution. If I don't know that solution, the internet is a great tool. This promote collaboration and technology skills."
I demonstrated leadership by always showing up to work and displaying respectful communication.
I developed a spreadsheet which helped us to keep a track of the cost budget sheet. That sheet was aacesible to all the employees on the job site and helped all the employees to spend accordingly.
"I did not get a lot of leadership opportunities this semester, but I did get to witness my mentor run weekly meetings. He had a definite leadership role in these meetings."
I did not have to deal with any stakeholders in this project
I didn't necessarily gain leadership from this internship but I got to see supervisors use it to keep the office running well.
"I don't have a specific situation-answer to this question, but my general policy when running events is to have everyone involved around to come up with ideas when we're trying to figure out how to set up an event. This involves many voices: myself, other employees, clients, and I, as the building tech am the one who leads the conversation toward what we can do and how we can bring ideas to reality. I do my best to incorporate as many of those voices as I can in the most effective capacity we can come up with."
I employed my leadership skills leading meetings.
I empower my desk associates to get as much work done as possible every day.
I empowered the coaches to want to change the lives of the middle school girls through our lesson plans.
I encourage discussion daily when I ask my coworkers about any improvements they would like to see in our department
I encourage discussion within my group and within the CEDC board of directors when asking for feedback or sharing ideas for a solution.
I encouraged a helpful discussion on a video script on the history of the Tiger Paw.
I encouraged discussion between all the employees by always listens to my peers and taking into consideration that someone could have a better and easier way to do things. An example is someone suggested putting more feed into the feed bins so we would not have to feed up the turkeys so many times a week.
I encouraged discussion between interns and directors regarding a trip to see manta rays. The interns felt very differently from the directors and I helped them to reach a solid middle ground.
I encouraged discussion over the rubrics I made to figure out what could be done differently or changed and what was done well.
I encouraged discussion with my mentees while having a group meeting. Each student do not learn everything at the same speed. I allowed them to share different study tips they had and other ideas that they thought would benefit the group.
I encouraged my co-worker to provide feedback if he had a different point of view than mine when working together on a project.
I encouraged my fellow internship to apply for 4-H extension agent positions post graduation and helped her prepare
I encouraged the SFG coaches to be the best leaders they could be for the girls and to inspire them.
I engaged anthropology club members to become involved in the new Business Anthropology course through a brief presentation and the distribution of fliers. I stressed the necessity of anthropology majors to gain business skills and how the course could benefit them. I also communicated accomplishments through agendas that were distributed to committee members.
I engaged the anthropology club to communicate the goals of the business anthropology program and was able to engage them to promote the program.
I enjoy the responsibility of leadership and am constantly growing to improve upon it.
"I entered this internship with minimal computer science and data visualization experience. As such, I actively learned as much as possible from the people around me. I noticed another intern, [name], taking responsibility and leadership over the creation and initiation of the CCIT Immersive Space. In our group meetings, he encouraged the other interns to take on various projects and worked to both better the space and have students regularly use it."
"I feel that I fell quite short of my potential as a leader this semester. I often found myself so caught up in my work that I failed to hold or attend the meetings I should have. Nonetheless, I did display SOME advanced leadership skills that I learned from studying. This skill was ""listening before speaking."" Rather than holding a meeting about a problem or idea and simply presenting my ideas and then asking for feedback, I would present the problem/ idea and ask for feedback BEFORE giving my input. This put me in a position to hear the unbiased thoughts of the rest of the team, thus giving me better data and making them feel more valued."
I feel that my leadership level has grown since I have worked here
I film and post student feature videos weekly. Students are nominated by staff. Sometimes the students I meet are camera shy but I also do my best to make them feel comfortable and confident. I often find that the students who share they are nervous behind the camera are the students whose stories shine.
I frequently received new technology tutorials from people within the department to learn how to use new programs.
I gave solutions to solve the problems of the line and robots.
I got to see my mentor lead groups at multiple events. There was always communication and other elements involved in the activities.
I got to see the social media marketing team be lead by [name] on what they need to be doing each week and he was very encouraging and helpful in planning out what videos/pictures they needed to capture and when to post them.
I got to sit in on a budget meeting where my supervisor and someone else worked together to change the budget to better fit the needs of that sport.
"I grew to be an expert in leadership this semester through continuous examination of my all of my mentors, including [mentor], [mentor], and even [mentor]. As Chief of Staff, I was tasked with leading the team safely through the semester and help them help others. I was in charge of training them in the beginning of the semester before school started and throughout the semester giving them advice not only related to internships but life as well."
"I had a problem mid-way through the semester with my higher up's not being responsible and allowing the lower ranking workers to get away with things that should not have been allowed. I had to call a meeting with everyone who was in that position to completely go over everything that they were supposed to have already been doing, and then added new steps to increase accountability in that position. I had to spend a lot of time checking back over their work to make sure that everything was on track, but so far the work has been exceptional!"
I had a task to write a script for data analysis. I proposed a solution for that algorithm and everyone was impressed with the idea. I was told that no intern had ever proposed such an effective solution like me. Now my program is being used by other groups as well.
"I had good communication with the supervisor that I had to report to. Since I was the first intern to join for that particular project, I helped the interns who joined later on to learn about the production process and the work that was expected from us."
"I had the opportunity to go to a CoCreate event: Photography Bootcamp. I spent the entire day with a large group of about 30-40 people. The main speaker was able to keep everyone engaged, answer questions thoroughly, provide great examples, and teach us a lot about photography. He knew people in the crowd, so he was able to use individuals in examples and talk about certain styles of photography for different occasions. He took us on a ""photo walk"" so that everyone would have a chance to try out what we had learned from his presentation and to see how he takes different types of pictures in and outdoors. Overall, he was a great instructor and leader."
"I had the opportunity to sit in on two different Board meetings; the first at the beginning of my internship and the second towards the end of my internship. In the beginning, I was able to explain to the key stakeholders in the organization the value that I was going to bring to the organization but also the vision I had for the few months I was there. I loved being able to go back and report the success I had with the Facebook page to the Board at the second meeting. They were able to buy into the need for the Facebook and Twitter through my beginning actions and allowed me to get participation from them for future posts."
"I had the pleasure of leading our student mentors. It was my job to make sure that they had all of the information/supplies they needed in order to effectively do their jobs. Additionally, it was my duty to make sure they all knew exactly what other roles they needed to perform as program leaders."
"I had the project of leading a development of a scholars program for first generation students. This project had multiple parts and communication was needed between the other interns in the department, along with [name] and our graduate student. This project is nearly complete, although the implementation of it may be postponed."
I had to be a very inspiring leader this semester to drive my mentees to better.
I had to create storyboards for videos and Instagram stories for the videographer. I had to explain these storyboards and get her to understand them and be excited about them as well.
"I had to drive the change to the new database, so I had the responsibility of taking leadership on this and making sure it was going in the correct direction. In our weekly staff meetings I would drive other team members to use the tool, and use it effectively."
I had to explain and convince the company to change their strategies about how to approach the market
I had to get photos from mentors in order to create a more updated website.
"I had to give a seminar presentation on the research my CI team and I did, and I was able to share lots of results from analyzing the data we were looking at and also share specific findings from certain group members."
I had to lead our monthly meetings and be the person to respond to emails with questions from students about the ME shop.
I had to make exeuctive decision.
I had to open the semester with one of my project team with a discussion of the different strategies the team could do to revitalize and make more relevant a website they were put in charge of running. I tried to encourage others to add input to each other's ideas and also encourage discussion of how those ideas could be realized.
"I had to present the idea of PEER Talks to [mentor] in order to be able to execute the event. We both want the best for PEER; therefore, I had to communicate my intentions and plan of execution."
"I have been a leader by starting my own articles without request. In order words, I found topics outside of my mentor's suiggestions and completed them based on my own initiative to succeed and bring news to Inside Clemson. Therefore, I was a conduit to assist multiple groups in having their voice be heard."
"I have been able to help plan the annual Christmas party. From this opportunity, I decided to make it a grand endeavor that meant more than simply cookies and sweaters. I was able to align the importance of the party with the importance of celebrating the employees. This connected to the larger mission of UDT and helped improve the workspace."
I have been able to take over things on the farm and make sure they get completed and lead others students to get jobs done.
"I have been given the lead role on several projects, but I believe this is a skill that you are continually developing."
I have been in the position where I was creating labs for the course and needed feedback to pursue the lab.
I have been learning from my mentor on how to escalate whenever there is an issue and if there is an obstacle preventing the progress of the project.
"I have been on lead for two manuscripts throughout my internship, and working with others to be sure we have all of the information we need has taught me how to be a leader and how to work with others to get things done."
"I have been working on a program that will allow freshman physicist to take tours of biophysics labs. There is a negative attitude toward biophysics among the undergraduates in the physics department, and this program would make sure the first impression freshmen have is positive, and accurately portrays what biophysics is. This program would also encourage freshmen to join biophysics labs if they like the research that is presented to them, and therefore allow them to get involved in research earlier in their college careers. I am currently gathering support from other biophysics labs, so we can showcase several research projects to freshmen. I hope to make our department more open to different types of research by keeping this program alive."
"I have been working to help develop an app for the NRT students. When doing this, I have had to meet with several different people from different departments and work with CCIT to determine which features we want in the app and how to create and run the app."
I have encouraged discussion between my mentees and I. They can communicate with each other and work together on homework assignments. They are also able to come to me for any help they need! This helps achieve the common goal between us for their success. I also encourage them to use the resources that PEER/WISE offers such as tutoring and the test bank.
I have full contact with the clients I have been given. I coordinate all communication between us.
I have gained so many great leadership skills through this interview. I have learned how to be a leader on a team and take initiative and work hard. I feel like I have shared a common vision for the library with my instruction team and communicated that vision though our efforts.
"I have given a motivational speech to my peers while working in a very hot, miserable portion of the day where we needed to transport hundreds of gallons of water by hand. Collectively, we banded together to make it happen even though it required two 11 hour workdays."
"I have had the privilege of seeing [name] and [name], my coworker, teach others. They have lead adults in staff training and children who have never even held a gun before. To me, I found this interesting because while both groups were learning something new, they were both big on positive construction to keep everyone safe, while still having fun."
"I have had to lead a lot the semester, especially with National Hunting and Fishing day. Running the camp game there was not only me having to organize children and lead them in the game, but I had to train the new volunteers as the came in to help. It ended up being a very successful day and enjoyed it greatly."
I have helped teach the grad and undergrad students in lab how to organize maintenance tasks so that everyone contributes aND the lab is kept running smoothly.
"I have helped with the ""it's not too late to study abroad"" campaign, by helping others figure out the best way to advertise for their program, since it is now my 2nd time with this campaign and other people's first time."
I have led the other interns in putting up the marketplace store. I encouraged everyone to provide opinions and feedback when making the store.
I have led training on how to better the incident report forum with current RA's and will be continuing those training to create a clear format to further ease the work of the hearing officers.
I have not had any experience with leadership this semester with UPIC. I only work under [mentor] and do not have sufficient contact with any other employee to provide an example.
I have observed the team members given an opportunity to own a requirement and being helpful if required.Ideas or suggestions of the team was encouraged and respected by everyone.
"I have once set up meetings with new customers and given them a tour of the lab, I was able to work with them to show them that we can fulfill what is needed to be done."
"I have planned many info sessions and class visits, as well as organized all of the students going abroad from the UNiC side, and Clemson's side."
I have seen the managers at Campus Banner + Design lead their interns towards a complete design project from start to finish.
I have served as team lead during my time here and had to delegate tasks accordingly based on student strengths.
"I have the duty of coordinating a videographer, photographer and candidate for each story to schedule a meeting and then lead the meeting."
"I have to become a leader when helping other students with the testing in Adopt-a-Stream, making sure they conduct the testing properly and guiding them along the way."
"I have watched quite a few meetings between [name], [name], and [name] as they discuss and determine how to regulate the extension program by directing their agents to certain jobs that fit well with their attributes, personalities, and knowledge."
"I have witnessed my mentor repetitively respect, and develop new ways to incorporate individuals and their unique backgrounds into our campaigns and objectives. She has encouraged me to bring this to my own action by designing posts to reach all groups of students when designing posts and images."
"I have witnessed my mentor repetitively respect, and develop new ways to incorporate individuals and their unique backgrounds into our campaigns and objectives. She has encouraged me to bring this to my own action by designing posts to reach towards Muslim students when the dining hall offers specific foods of their culture during particular times of the month."
I haven't had any of these experiences
"I haven't held really leadership positions, but being a mentor has allowed me to be a leader to other students."
I held lead new coworkers in production jobs. i teach them techniques needed for several materials.
I help lead programs on a regular basis
I helped a co-worker see an easier way to find Clemson's branding fonts and was always willing to help her when she asked.
"I helped align the objectives of a group of students and their Professor, [name], involved in the ""Assessing the EU's Influence"" Creative Inquiry project by interviewing the students in the presence of [name], who facilitated their responses within the scope of her own expertise. This aligned the learning experiences of the students involved in the project with the objectives of the Professor that they were assisting in researching the European Union, thus working toward a broader global objective in better understanding how Americans students and researchers interact with the EU."
I helped another employee figure out how to properly complete a job assignment that was necessary for the accounting department to function.
I helped connect National Scholars with other groups like Clemson MSA and SPLC which led to various events being co-hosted by these groups.
I helped encourage teams to bring in canned goods for our canned food drive.
I helped encouraged discussion about how to better our social media pages in order to appeal to students more and humanize the Parking Services department.
I helped fellow employees work through projects and gave advice on designs.
"I helped further connected the Alper Lab and the Sanabria Lab in the physics department. The Sanabria Lab has equipment that the Alper Lab needs for an experiment. I contacted Dr. Sanabria and asked if we could use the equipment. One of his graduate students will help us with the project. This is beneficial to us because we need the equipment, and it is beneficial to the Sanabria Lab because if they help us, they can get recognized in our papers and presentations. These labs already have a good relationship, but maintaining this is important to our Biophysics community."
"I helped in creating a collaborative document online and a chat group to discuss/update the work done by each of us towards finishing a project. For other day-to-day tasks, I have always initiated in splitting up the work amongst us and always try to mediate the discussion to arrive at a solution."
I helped numerous students realize they had the power to go abroad and make this dream a reality to them. I was a resource for them giving them the tools they needed to go and complete their goals.
"I helped organize the other interns to work on parts of the marketplace store, whether it was something like taking images for content or working on advertising efforts."
"I helped our graduate assistant with the ""Intern of the Semester"" project. For the student who we awarded this to, I was responsible for putting together a prize basket to recognize the intern's accomplishment. I went to local Clemson businesses and explained to them what our goal was and how they would be featured in our UPIC magazine. I got several companies to donate and was able to show this success to the rest of the UPIC team."
I helped set up the on-boarding process for other interns as they came into the company
I helped some of the interns that were just starting this semester learn how to do some of the common things in the building.
I helped the interns connect with the techs and lead then in jobs that we were given.
I helped the social media team develop a brand strategy that could be expanded across all of the different projects.
I helped the student org complete several events they wanted to do.
"I initiated a lot of ideas in the office about improving social media tactics. By adding in more features of students, our social media accounts became more personable to our audience."
I joined the project discussion and meeting and observed how the project leader organizes and distribute the tasks of a project to team members.
I lead a lot of projects for my Director of North America and VP of North America. Need I say more?
"I lead a project to set up the groundwork for a study abroad program to Lorraine, France through Georgia Tech. To set up this groundwork, I had to leverage my connections in the mechanical engineering department to work with the study abroad office. Additionally, I participated in collaborative conversations between Georgia Tech and Clemson."
"I lead a small group of other interns for completing a project based upon developing a heat map for Statistical Process Control all over the machining area of plant, for the upcoming automotive audit of plant."
I lead a team discussion on the leading topics about sensitive topics/scenarios in training where we learned how to approach situations if ever presented.
"I lead Clemson Life student, [name], through the process of video editing."
I lead many colleagues in understanding the software Timer Pro

I lead the store managers on establishing a more efficient employee management and organization system.
I lead the team meeting and I always encourage the team to give me feedback and express their opinion on what they will like to discuss. They will always share with me problem they have encounter that we can discussed as a team for future improvement.
"I learned a great deal about team leadership and project management from simply watching my supervisors and superiors in my team. They often had to identify and make use of many different peoples backgrounds and skill sets. Often products and projects assigned to our team required implementing Bluetooth capabilities, so we were required to work with electrical and software engineers outside of our group to help accomplish this goal."
I learned to trust others in the process of putting on a show. I had to help them believe that they were capable of being great performers even though many of them were first-timers.
I led a group during the brainstorm session so that we could come together and create content for articles.
"I led a social media content team composed of 3 Clemson students. It was my responsibility to lead and encourage them throughout their design work, as well as communicate and help with anything they may have struggled with. I became a much stronger leader by being responsible for these students and serving as their mentor over the course of the semester."
I led an activity during a student manager meeting that focused on what qualities other student managers would like to see more of in their coworkers. It sparked a great discussion and we all discovered that we would like more communication with one another and we came up with ways to foster that.
"I led an information session on being global exchange in engineering. I contacted students interested in doing exchange, clemson engineering students who had done exchange and students from other univerisites on exchange at clemson all for an infosession. It was really successful and had close to 40 people come and interact with one another."
I led discussion about introducing a new way to market the institute and we implemented some of my changes.
I Led my fellow interns in different projects and served as a mentor in some areas. I also led my student organization on projects and recruitment tasks.
"I led our team in hiring and training 5 new staff members, as well as moving 3 members up to management positions. I printed and screened over 30 resumes for this onboarding process and shared with each interviewer what each interviewee was going to bring to our desk."
"I led projects like MFMEA, designing layout."
"I led the PEER Talks event by completely planning it and delegating responsibilities. [Mentor] wanted to honor the 30th Anniversary of PEER with a big event and I was able to fully develop that idea. PEER Talks was my ""brain-child"" and I was able to engage alumni and celebrate different aspects of the mission statement for PEER"
"I led the project development that relates to testing the input and output ports of the instant control board. During our weekly meeting, I was able to discuss the shortcomings present in the control system and initiated the conversation within the group which led us to possible solution for the problem at hand."
"I made a brand identity guideline for the Immersive Space at the Watt Center. I presented it to the interns who work in the space and we discussed it. I listened to their different points of view about the space, its goals, and the future trajectory of the space. We began developing a shared vision of the brand and aimed to achieve the common goal of promoting the space in an effective, consistent way."
I made and designed various surveys for current National Scholars to collect information for the NSP directors to use for programmatic purposes.
"I made sure certain product support cases were properly taken care of before they were escalated to the next level of support, which follows company policies."
"I managed three different project teams for Clemson Engineers for Developing Countries. Often, these groups need data from the on-ground interns and our faculty and industry advisers. I also had the opportunity to travel to Cange, Haiti this spring break to experience the community that I am working with. I spent a good part of the semester communicating information about Cange and the needs there to these project teams. It is also within my position to ensure all written deliverables align with the organization's overall mission and apply to the needs of the people."
I mentioned in another competencies answer that one of my goals was to enhance our fundraising opportunities. Another idea that I had was to implement the Instagram story to sell Comfort Color Study Abroad t-shirts. I asked the participation from all interns to promote the t-shirts on their stories. We sold them for $12 each and made a total of $252.
I motivated the team.
I never had an opportunity to deal with a group.
I never really was exposed to any groups or leadership roles.
"I noticed that during my internship, my mentor [mentor] did a great job of helping capitalize on everyone's unique strengths. He knew that interviewing was one of my strengths so he asked me to do particularly tough interviews."
I noticed that the graphic designer was really good at delegating tasks to her assistant when she knew the asistant's talents would be more applicable to those tasks. This helped the assistant and the graphic designer to use thier talents most efficiently.
I observe a supervisor or other employee develop groups and lead them towards achieving a shared vision or goal almost every day. Producing for NFL Films is strenuous and taxing job and requires meetings and guidance every day.
"I observed a lot of advising sessions that the coordinators held for students going on different study abroad programs. I noticed that they gave their full attention to an individual student and listened intently as they described what they were looking for in a study abroad program. The coordinators then factored in personal preferences, cultural background, financial situation, etc to find the exact right program for a student. Sometimes these sessions would last up to an hour, but the coordinators were happy to sit there for as long as it took to make sure that the student walked out of there happy with their decision. They would also look at an individuals strength's when considering programs to determine if they'd do better on a faculty-directed, exchange, or third-party program, which vary in levels of responsibility and independence."
I observed [name] as she led and conducted interns toward their specific goals.
I observed my mentor and other coworkers collaborating together to make descriptive news letters for our program.
"I observed my mentor taking initiative to achieve a common goal all throughout my internship. She connected with business partners from all backgrounds to gather information and resources. For example, she connected with business acumen team to arrange a call center site visit for everyone in the team. This site visit would potentially improve team members' understanding of different business and customer needs. Understanding needs is pivotal to device strategies to achieve a common goal."
I observed my supervisor assign duties to my fellow intern. He managed to identify her strong points and assigned responsibilities accordingly.
I observed my supervisor in numerous occasions leading various groups towards a shared goal. One example is when we sat down with people at GSP airport and developed a plan and figured out the expectations for their new website that we would be creating for them.
"I observed them from my onsite Supervisor [mentor]. He kept the power distance low so that the team confided their actual problems. In my previous experience I saw colleagues hiding critical information from their supervisors. But when [mentor] pushed for something to be done, everybody followed as well."
"I observes the HERDS director lead a team by giving individuals tasks that played to their strengths while making sure to emphasize the importance of every team member,"
"I often planned how we would organize an event an offer that idea. When I did so for a wedding, my idea was approved and then I instructed the rest of my team on how to accomplish this plan."
I often table the events alone and am solely responsible for getting people to participate in events.
I often try to empower those that I communicate with in the football concession stands as they have as much power as me to make a difference in terms of sustainability.
I often viewed members of Prospect Research working together on a goal.
I organized groups of students who are from universities abroad with student who are travelling there in the spring and students who have studied there in the past. I organized times and meeting places and guided the discussion so that the student going abroad felt comfortable asking questions and the students from abroad felt comfortable giving advice.
"I organized meetings with the other global departments to discuss ways and strategies to achieve the common goal, improve recruitment for going abroad."
I participated in PEER Snapshot by co-leading a tour through Clemson's materials science department.
I participated in weekly meetings in the office where I was constantly leading discussion about different topics.
"I participated on a project that would make product storage more efficient. This project would eventually tie into multiple departments, and as such was composed of members of each by the project leader. Everyone openly collaborated with each other on how best to tackle this project, shifting perspectives from each one and recognizing their specific expertise on aspects of the project. It was expertly managed by the project leader and executed by everyone. I was still inexperienced but was invited on the project precisely for that reason - to provide an unbiased perspective and ask questions that those more experienced might not consider."
"I planned and conducted a class on manners/etiquette to a youth 4-H club, in which they had to be very involved and engage in activities."
I presented on my project thus far and encouraged my fellow peers in ways to improve on the mistakes that I have made along the way.
I ran the team meetings. I realize I keep bringing this up but this took up most of my project time and lead to a lot of situations that empowered me to help others and share their own opinions on issues the whole team wished to correct.
I reached out to student organizations and collaborated with them in order to help them plan events at the Barnes Center next semester. During these collaboration meetings I helped them brainstorm event ideas and encouraged them to be creative and have forethought. I reported the results of these meetings back to my mentor.
"I really only had reliable daily contact with my mentor and my supervisor. Multiple times a day, my mentor would keep us up to date with projects that needed attention as well as prioritizing those that were more important or time sensitive. While doing this, he was able to keep a level head with himself as well as with his coworkers and schedule tasks proficiently without any hiccups."
I recall assisting a group of clients who didn't know what direction they wanted to take an assigned project. I assisted them in creative direction by offering different routes to approach the core problem and what it would take to do so.
I saw a supervisor put a team together and lead them to a goal to put on an event. The event was very successful and I learned much from it.
I saw [mentor] take 15 students from all backgrounds and mold us into a collective unit. I was fortunate enough to be a part of this. His goal was to see us succeed and learn along the way and he helped us accomplish those two goals by being our mentor.
I saw my company manager in meetings where he would form a team of all the department heads and tell them the objective they need to meet and that only working together and communicating effectively is the option forward without having internal conflicts to obtain it.
"I saw my leader recognize that I was great at washing and grading eggs, so when that task had to be done, I was the one to do it."
"I saw my professor harness my skills as a graduate student in cleaning the data, use the skills of a proficient data scientist to do more advanced work and also to teach me. I also saw her use the experience of her colleagues in their areas of expertise to implement the project better."
I saw my supervisor bring out the best in all team members. He encouraged everyone to take part in the discussion and learn from the experience.
"I saw this when I watched my mentor, [mentor], identify strengths and talents in our team, including myself and our other interns, and assign specific work we could do together as a team, but things that fit our abilities the best. I saw how she was able to manage our Law Enforcement summit preparation along with [name] our GA."
"I see people operating within their strengths all throughout the office. My supervisor does a lot of research and data analysis and once she has the information, she often passes the information along to someone else in the office. They typically have the job of taking her information and putting it in visual form."
"I served as a conduit to assist groups in aligning objectives with broader goals of the Honors College in my role of leading the Honors ambassador committee. This is a group of student ambassadors who create novel ideas of how to make the prospective student experience as well as ambassador program more beneficial. This semester, I partnered with some of the committee members during the interview process for new ambassadors. In part of the interview, we were role playing what a prospective visit would be like with a student to evaluate how personable each applicant was. Initially, the role playing was not as professional as I wanted it to be so I was able to discuss what I imagined the role playing situation would be like with the committee member. Working with them, I was able to align our goals to the overall goal of the Honors College to have personable and knowledgeable ambassadors to help the prospective students!"
I served as a conduit when I combined the efforts of Healthy Campus and the Michelin Career Center to put on an outreach event for these 2 departments. I provided tip sheets to students on how to maintain holistic wellness and provided them with resources to help monitor their mental health and destress.
I served as a facilitator of a student-based panel during SEE Clemson. The idea was to separate the students from their parents so they can ask any personal or general questions about Clemson. I led two 45 min panel sessions and lead the discussion that included the pros/cons of Clemson and everyday tips to become a successful college student.
"I served as a leader by helping to edit the intern book for next year. While I unfortunately will not get a chance to meet the intern, I like to think I helped them through this form of advice."
I served as a liaison for the students of the Honors College and the Honors College staff. I had to work with various organizations within the Honors College and offer assistance and advice when they came to me to get information about how to promote their programs.
I showed leadership by helping the children in the 4-H program to achieve their goals.
I sometimes had to direct videos and those in the video to recreate our ideas.
I spent some time during this internship training another intern on how to perform weekly radiation surveys in Clemson labs. This enabled her to become a part of the research safety team at Clemson and to perform a vital function.
"I started clocking in for my shirt at least thirty minutes early at the beginning of the semester in order to make sure all of my responsibilities were completed in a timely manner. Soon after, my other coworkers began to clock in early as well when they saw how much smoother their daily duties went when they got them done earlier."
I supervised student activities
I support everyone in our office and I try to empower others to strive to do their best. I have had so many opportunities to learn about the vision of the COB and how to continue the vision.
I think I always my boss let me do what then I will do what.
"I think leadership and collaboration were tied closely together during my internship because the advisors work so closely together at the ASC. When trying to figure out what our student population needed, I asked the advisors for their opinions on workshop topics that the students would benefit from learning and what the most popular majors are. Everyone had diverse ideas and I had the privilege of combining them to make a well- rounded support program."
"I think my time as EU's project lead was an effective one. I think one of my biggest assets is being able to convince a group of people to be interested in a topic, which I think is due to my positive attitude and passion for things I'm a part of. As such, with EU having more new interns than usual this semester, I made it a point to work with my team to bring about the point that we needed to work together to set a foundation for what the new EU would look like."
"I think one area that I have seen this through is how we respond to our negative comments on social media. When we respond, we must remember that we represent the entire department and speak for everyone when we respond to these things."
"I think our office is unique in that we are assigned specific jobs but each person usually ends up working on everything that goes through the office in one way or another. We are an incredibly collaborative group, often asking for design advice from other employees and even asking them to take over a job we aren't sure about. I often find that I spearhead jobs and then delegate to other people throughout the whole thing, making sure that each person's opinions are heard and everyone feels valued and useful."
"I think that I am a good leader, but there were definitely others in my internship that knew more about the field than me. I preferred having them lead and show me the ropes. I personally gained leadership experience from how they taught me."
I think that something that worked very well for myself and the other interns in my department was having bi-weekly meetings. We were able to encourage one another on goals that we all were reaching for. I was able to support and help encourage other interns in the similar field I was working in.
I took a lot of initiative this semester by actively seeking project from my mentor in order to not only help the department for the future but to also allow myself to apply my skills and foster the same initiative in other employees so that anyone in our staff would feel confident
"I took initiative several times to contact multiple groups around campus and inquire about possible press release topics they may want to share. I did investigative research that I was then able to communicate with my supervisor. Often times, my initial information was used by collaborators to enhance a story."
"I took it upon myself to create a few promo tools to help the Outdoor Lab gain more awareness. My boss didn't necessarily tell me they needed them, but I knew that he wanted to achieve a higher awareness for the business. In the end, we created some great material to move closer towards their vision."
I took it upon myself to start a new social media campaign for Clemson Online's instagram called staff spotlight. I presented how I thought this would be beneficial to Clemson Online's overall vision and I was given the opportunity.
I took leadership in my role on the project by asking questions and looking for opportunities to help out.
I trained student workers to collect data.
I trained two new employees which would provide support for the overbearing workload.
I tried implementing the different form of concreting which can help the team to prevent the level differences on the job site.
I tried implementing the different form of concreting which can help the team to prevent the level differences on the job site.
"I try to empower the other workers by letting them give their feedback on the magazine. I let them have a say in my work and I give opinions/critique on their work as well. I also showed leadership by running some meetings and asking others to work on specific projects. I also try to show leadership when someone backs out of something or can not do a project, I will step in and take over to make sure the project gets done. For example, we had an interview video to make and the photographer/videographer could not make it last minute. Instead of canceling I decided to still do the interview myself so it would still get done on time."
I undertook many new projects this semester that were new and different from things I have worked on in the past.
"I was a motivator for the team. Even when times looked rough, I told them that they are more than capable to complete tasks and projects."
I was a part of a Formula student team-Praheti Racing which made its maiden expedition to a Formula student competition in Italy. My team captain had very good leadership skills who believed in the concept of 'lead by example'. He was the one who identified the interests of a few students and started the first Formula student team in the college. He divided the teams into sub-teams based on the unique capabilities/strengths of various students and it proved to be effective.
"I was a project management office intern. So I often served as a moderator in quite a few meeting, where I encouraged everyone to express their opinions so we could make sure our decisions were efficient and well informed."
I was able to connect students who were going abroad to the same places together to make sure each had their questions answered that they may have not thought of just yet.
I was able to create the job task board several times and lead the crew throughout the day in order to bring the golf course to an acceptable day to day condition successfully.
"I was able to create the problem definition on my own, I asked suggestion from my team mates to create good problem definition where I made myself to solve a more meaningful problem."
I was able to help the new employees understand how to complete different tasks.
I was able to lead my team in a situation where critical information was required to be privided regarding a speeding gps logic that we were implementing.
I was able to lead other interns by examples and teach and also receive instruction from them to bring about success on the field.
I was able to run labs for different classes that came through the lab in order to educate. I was also tasked with giving a tour of the lab to help people further understand what we do in the lab.
"I was able to see the HR do such a great job at recognizing the hard work that each staff member does. They hosted a nurse appreciation week, a janitorial appreciation week, a family fun day for families of the staff, and constantly praised people for hard work. I contributed to family fun day and received a thank you letter later that week from HR and that spoke volumes to me about how I should treat my co-workers one day."
I was able to take charge of certain tasks that were given to me. So I was given the responsibility and leadership to complete them on my own. I wasn't really given take many leadership opportunities. But I think it was hard to do that in my type of setting.
"I was able to teach another intern about Adobe Creative Cloud programs, more specifically After Effects. I was also able to answer any questions she had throughout her internship as she was learning these programs along the way."
I was asked to lead the project. The objectives were very broad. Thus I asked individuals for long term goals and the mission of the office. Based on that response I created a specific set of objectives that the website will meet and enforce the office's vision.
I was chosen from all the other interns to go to an onsite visit with one of our clients. I was then responsible for preparing a report about what I learned there and then filing the report so we could refer back to it in the future.
I was given a lot more responsibility this semester and kind of left in charge of the Pinckney Leadership Conference.
I was given the opportunity to make decisions for the project.
I was helping on a case where two agents were in disagreements on how to achieve a particular task. I was able to offer my idea which included a little of both of their methods.
"I was in charge of a group of students involved in our 3D printing project, and some students were initially wary of the value of the project, but after discussing the benefits and cons of it, they were more excited to participate."
"I was in charge of each project I was assigned, which shows a large amount of leadership"
"I was in charge of leading the renovation budget project. I brought the team together and determined who would be in charge of what improvements. I had them give me updates on how their part was going and then at the end, we all sat down and put together the budget. It was very effective and effeicent and it allowed to be a leader and learn how to delegate."
"I was in charge of the ""From the Horses Mouth"" pieces for the literacy grant. This meant that for each lesson of the grant I wrote all the information for the lesson."
I was in charge of the hackathon
"I was in charge of the Honors Ambassador Committee which was current student ambassadors who were really involved and passionate about the program and help come up with new ideas and determine the direction of the program. During our meetings, I would have a list of topics and introduce the goal of the topic as it related to the Honors Ambassador program and then let them discuss. There were a lot of useful ideas generated and I implemented many of the ideas they came up with."
I was in the position of helping some of the photography interns with their lighting and compositions. The people that I worked with trusted my judgement and everything turned out great.
I WAS INSPIRED BY HOW MUCH COMMAND MY DEPARTMENT HEAD AT ALL THE MEETINGS AND CONFERENCES. HE LED AND INSPIRED PEOPLE EVERYDAY AND I WOULD OFTEN HEAR PEOPLE SAY I WOULD I WOULD WANT TO DISCUSS WITH [mentor] BEFORE TAKING ANY DECISION ABOUT THE PROJECT
"I was invited to many meetings where the managers, engineers and supervisors discussed how to improve the work they are doing and how to reach the goals. I got to learn how they work and how to work to stay on top of the game."
I was involved in some of the meetings with the senior QEs. I was really imperessed by the way they communicated to their sub ordinates and perfectly delegated work to others. They used to very carefully listen to the problems faced by all the engineers and tried to support them or atleast give a direction for them to achieve the goal. He also tried to prioritize all the problems in the dept every week to make sure the team was aware about the problems.
I was leading the cost-saving project providing directions to other team members to worl progressively.
"I was new to this so I didn't fill a leader role but I did often teach those unskilled in Premiere how to do it and helped them with that. Plus, I know I will help more in the future."
"I was not involved in Leadership role that much, But I was involved in a six sigma project where I interacted with Operators and Supplier for the Improvement."
I was offered an officer position in an adjoining organization related to my internship based on my leadership skills as I take the lead role on projects and delegate and ask for feedback.
I was often the most experienced member on the gameday team where I had to lead the less experienced interns to create the best content
I was preparing a meetings for our group with the scientists that we collaborated with and sometimes I had to lead the meeting and discussion.
"I was privileged to sit in on several team meetings this semester, and I thought that every individual on my team did a good job of recognizing the strengths of their coworkers. It was evident from the beginning that most employees within the development office have strong relationships with their peers. During collaborative event meetings, each role was delegated to the person who had the best skill set to handle the job."
"I was put in charge of developing a protocol for a PhD. candidate's research. I had to test many possibilities and create standard operating protocol documents for this candidate. I was then responsible for explaining the process to my other team members, and communicating with the candidate to make sure I was doing what he needed."
I was responsible for writing the seasonal newsletter for Smart Fit Girls. This newsletter includes all updates on SFG at schools all over America. I collaborated with team members and used their feedback to develop the newsletter that was distributed to all SFG followers in the United States.

I was tasked to set up a meeting with one of the health research librarians for other interns in the department and myself to gain more insight and knowledge of research. I initiated the groups' discussion by preparing some topics to discuss and cover in the meeting that I thought all of us would be interested in gaining more knowledge in and a topic that was common between us all through the material that we were working on in our office/department. This allowed for us to come together and have a chance to share and listen to each others ideas and visions an use it to help better our work in our department.
I was tasked with research golf cart options for our office. I visited and many golf cart dealers learning all that is involved with purchasing a golf cart. I then had to combine my findings and pitch to my bosses why we should purchase a golf cart and which option to go with. I had to pitch how this purchase would enable individuals in our office to further excel at their positions.
I was the first intern to join in this project. Took time to learn the nuances of my work. Two interns joined later and I showed them around the model line and trained them for work.
I was the head of the project and idea so I had to align people from different groups to work together to make this a reality.
I was the lead on the Clemson Guide App project and co-lead on the School Book project. I had to communicate closely with many people through these projects and give updates as to what was happening on these projects.
I was the oldest SEC so I helped and trained the others.
"I was told to delineate a sale area, with several SMZ's and lake-fronts, and several ideas of how it should be best laid out (one from the forester, and one from the forest manager). I collaborated with both of them in order to lay it out to the best possible outcome."
I was under intern co-op program where the program mentors encourage the interns on a bi-weekly basis to perform better and teach us what improvements can be done which would overall develop professionalism
I watched my other employees in the graphic design area consult one another to get feedback on the work they had been doing to get another perspective and adjust accordingly based on that feedback.
I watched my supervisor capitalize on our strengths while we were creating newsletters over the course of the semester. He would look to me for editing and word play and he would look to my colleague for her social media skills to make the posts standout.
I witnessed my mentor [mentor] lead her team in an effective way that capitalized on the unique strengths of the individuals on her team. She recognizes the effort that her team puts into their work and frequently thanks both myself as an intern and her full-time employees for our help and effort to achieve the team's goals. She respects her team by always making any work that is not directly in their job description an optional activity that they can decide to participate in if they want. She develops her employees by encouraging and mentoring them in their current roles and by thinking of their future within the department and how they could grow. She also knows the strengths of her team well and assigns tasks based on those strengths.
I work I independently the majority of the time therefore there are not many opportunities to lead groups. However I see independent working as another form of leadership.
I work to lead creative inquiry groups and other interested on campus organizations in serving as an extension of the Clemson agricultural extension program and working to connect the community and Clemson students to local food systems.
"I work with a diverse group at the Security Operations Center with different knowledge about dealing with cyber security threats and preempt cyber security threats. For example, I know a lot of the inner workings of how threats spread and can be detected in the network, while my co-intern is good at detecting and taking action for host based infections. Another coworker is good at auditing for details about how the incident happened and we all work together to resolve the issue."
I work with many different computer softwares as part of my internship. We use IMleagues.com for class registration. This program has many issues and is always giving participants and instructors issues. During the first staff meeting of the semester I lead a discussion on these issues and how we can work together to fix them.
"I worked a couple of tabling events in which I answered prospective families' questions about Parking and Transportation Services at Clemson. This required me to listen to someone's specific concern, and tailor my answer to their situation. I had to give space for the person to formulate their question, and generate a positive discussion surrounding their concerns."
I worked alongside other graphic designers to complete major projects and we were able to successfully create a final product that please everyone.
"I worked with a Career Ambassador to share information on recorded interviews to students. [Mentor], my mentor, gave me full independence in the project with the CA. I created graphics on Adobe Spark and showed the CA my vision. I then directed her in a series of videos to post online."
I worked with a fellow intern to help assist me in writing some code for the open nms system.
I worked with my co photography intern to set up for and plan department portraits and took initiative to seek out those who were missing or didn't show up for their time slot on their own and found someone else in the department to take the portraits if I was unable to.
I worked with my mentors to get them involved with PEER by serving on the alumni panel for PEER Talks
I worked with other student managers to train new employees. I was able to show them how we trained students in previous years and encouraged them to work together to make the training as effect as possible.
I would always reinforce that my one coworker knew what she was doing or I would teach her how to do tasks.
I would consistently observe my supervisor in order to gain new insight
I would help others when needed
I would help the new employees learn how to do different things at work.
I would observe my supervisors having their weekly meetings and talking about what we needed to accomplish over the coming weeks.
I would often take this roll by planning out what would have to be completed each day.
"I'm the maintenance lead and my role is to make sure all the machines are functioning properly. With that, I have a huge responsibility along with my leadership."
I've been able to partner with others by assisting them in whatever they may need in order to achieve the shared vision of process improvement on campus.
"I've encouraged and commended one coworker on several occasions, to try and get her to come out of her shell and take on her responsibilities at the magazine."
I've had to basically lead an assessment when my boss was not there.
"I've held multiple leadership positions throughout my time at Clemson. I led our team of interns in the school book project and organized the whole thing. I was able to lead my fellow interns in how to interact with the students and led the students to realize their potential with their writing and reading. However, we all came together with a shared vision of getting the students more interested in reading, and the goal of having the students continue reading and writing when they're home over summer vacation."
I've observed [name] and his vision for how the building is to be run when we were learning the way the systems interact with each other.
"I've seen how my mentor and his boss, [name], facilitate discussion in meetings with others in CCIT. They make sure everyone's voice is heard and they make sure we stay on track to achieving the desired goal."
I've spent the semester watching my mentor learn about our new employees and how they each work best and learn. Seeing her adapt to their qualities was a good learning experience for me.
"In a leadership position for the Pearce Digital Marketing team, I helped brainstorm with and lead my peer [name] to her writing subject for her blog post this semester. She was having trouble picking what to write about and I helped her reflect on the semester going over what might be valuable for her to write and the community to read. Additionally, every mandatory meeting we had with the entire group I would synthesize the work we had done for the social media team that week to our UPIC Mentors and what we had in store for the next week."
"In a meeting with my fellow interns and supervisor, I suggested that instead of holding weekly workshops, we do bi-monthly workshops and have armark cater the events."
"In a meeting, I brought up a topic about a specific problem with a process and a possible solution that I had thought of. Others then contributed and spoke about other possible solutions to the problem."
In a Monday meetings we express new ideas. this is satire where you could share something with the group and let them vision the ideas that you think about. If the idea is good enough we will pursue it a a whole and move forward with it.
In almost all of our team meeting we were able to voice concern and ideas for how our team could operate at an even higher level.
"In an effort to save power in the building, I proposed that one of my projects from last semester be considered to be used in order to minimize the time where computers are on and not doing anything. I also proposed a few different methods of monitoring power draw of computers in the building."
"In an engineering meeting, we had to discuss as a group how to best find a solution. There were two solutions agreed upon so we split into two teams to compare the outcomes."
"In an office with another intern, we both shared the leadership role, but I typically was the one that kept us on schedule and kept everyone encouraged to continue on, even when we got frustrated with technology. This allowed everyone to keep going and press on until we had a version of the site ready for a test run."
"In bi-weekly lab meetings with our mentor, my colleague and I gave project updates. We would describe difficulties we were having and then we would all discuss how we could solve/combat these difficulties and move forward in our work."
"In certain situations, we encouraged one another to spitball ideas as to how to solve IT problems"
"In Clemson Video Services, we seek to produce professional videos for Clemson University. Once when another fellow intern is editing, she asked me for advice on certain video editing techniques that she lacks proficiency. Through patiently demonstrating the proper techniques, we were able to finish a beautiful and professional video."
"In conducting 3 Day Startup as my first event, part of the event was getting students to come together in groups to decide on a product or idea they wanted to work on over the course of the week. In doing this, there were inevitably different ideas among the group on the directions each team wanted to take on their product. I met with each team, listened to the different perspectives, and encouraged ways they could combine their idea together to take an even better direction."
"In Disney, there are these things called ""Four Keys Cards"" that the employees can receive when they are doing an excellent job in a certain area and this gets put on their record and shows that they are an exceptional employee and can help when trying to get further into the company."
"In fundraising for The Vagina Monologues, I came up with a craft idea. I shared that idea with another intern and then worked with her to acheive what I had envisioned and incorporate her ideas. I then updated our supervisor on the progress we had made."
"In interviews with students that I conducted, I had to ask a lot of questions about their lives and experiences at Clemson. I tried to encourage them to be truthful and open so we could really achieve the goal of telling their stories."
"In many day to day tasks, I converse with others that I work with and encourage others to voice their ideas. When making decisions I take into consideration others point of views and ideas."
In meetings I would often lead discussions regarding how we are currently structured and operating to allow everyone to voice opinions on we could achieve our goals more efficiently.
in MMS I dirved the project show I had to show right direction to the team.
"In my campus recreation internship I sat in on a meeting on how campus recreation can market to the school their new area of Fike Recreation. They were scared the new area would only be attractive to men and no women would use it. I recommended, during the first week of opening, we have trainers there prepared to help anyone who didnt know how to use the equipment. I thought more women would be inclined to use the new area if this was the case."
"In my group of interns, there is a wide variety of majors. It varies from chemical engineering, to electrical engineering, to civil engineering, to others. When presenting ideas about how we could save the company money, I had to be careful how I explained my thought process, since we all come from different backgrounds of specialties in engineering. I had to be detailed enough for the chemical and electrical engineers to know what to do, and simple enough for the civil engineers to help with the big picture of the problem faced."
"In my internship, I came across information for a grant application from Johnson&Johnson about nursing technology and innovation. I introduced this to my mentor and my fellow interns. We then decided to work together to apply for the grant, to hopefully increase nursing access to developing technologies such as 3D Printers."
"In my internship, I presented a small powerpoint on the applications of 3D printing in healthcare to the School of Nursing Community Advisory Board."
"In my meetings with the social media student team, I regularly participated in and encouraged discussion where individuals expressed different points of view to develop a shared vision for Clemson's social media presence. I enjoyed working in that sort of atmosphere because I watched several different viewpoints come to the table, and then we would all discuss and combine them to create one unified viewpoint. This was a successful way of running Clemson's social media, as it ensured the media was created on several different levels and from several different stances, and made the whole department more well-rounded."
"In my project, I have three people including me in the team. Sometimes, we had different arguments and didn't agree with another person's argument. To overcome this, I usually listened to their arguments first. Then, I gave another opinion and told them why I didn't like their arguments and why they should agree with my argument. Of course, that's just my opinion. I didn't force them to agree with my argument."
"In my role as the primary connection between the Watt Family Innovation Center and the Clemson Immersive Space, I worked to balance individual objectives of both groups while maintaining a focus on the common overall goal of improving student success through increased access to disruptive technologies. For example, the Watt Center emphasizes cleanliness throughout its building as a part of its brand, so I ensured that promotional materials within the Immersive Space fell within these guidelines (were either explicitly Watt-sanctioned or adhered to the spirit of the Watt brand). Meanwhile, the Immersive Space had the objective of promoting collaboration among student groups, so midway through the semester I successfully lobbied the Watt Center for permanent access to an additional large collaborative display in the space. Throughout discussions for Immersive Space planning and the Watt Center's vision for VR deployment, I consistently aimed to find common ground for the two groups that would promote collaboration and increase potential for all sides to help students in new ways."
"In my role I have served as the head strategist for the Clemson Immersive Space, so I set goals for branding, operations, and outreach. I have led a staff team of four students (including myself) in establishing consistent operating hours and procedures in the Immersive Space. I also interact with users and lead group interactions with VR technology in the space on a regular basis."
"In my work with the Moments campaign, I took part in meetings where my mentor worked with others to decide which Clemson students to highlight. There was a heavy emphasis on diversity and inclusion and in finding the right story."
"In one attempt to connect Luck Box, LLC with sizable investors and shareholders I displayed advanced leadership qualities. Flying in to Las Vegas, NV to meet ""Big Fish"" prospects, I spent 3 days working with and aligning a vision with these potential investors. I was able to also align the marketing team at Luck Box to share the vision I had crafted with these investors. In the end, I was able to align the visions of a marketing team with big time shareholders towards a common goal for innovation in the senior medical sector."
"In one of my projects it was paramount to glean information from as many operators as I could, to determine what might work well, what might not, and what problems I should take into consideration when thinking about my projects because many of these operators have more experience than I do and different opinions and experience which allowed me to accumulate a broad perspective to decide what and how to implement recommendations from my project."
"In one of our larger group meetings, I watched [name] (another social intern) lead a meeting by giving numerous of thoughts. I would then also give my opinion. This helped me become more confident."
"In order to empower others, I allowed trainees to do protocols first alongside me, and then encouraged them to do the protocols themselves once they felt comfortable on their own. In doing so, the three of us had to work together to achieve experiment goals originally set by myself and [name] through the two years I have been in the lab. Part of this experience also included communicating to others via Poster presentations etc the status of the research and future directions of the lab."
"In order to execute successful programs that appeal to new generations of youth, it is important to use new ideas. This includes groupthinking with other people and reaching a common goal based on shared ideas."
"In order to facilitate discussion in the online workshop, I created discussion questions that were required for participants and gave positive feedback to those that were not only answering the question but also adding content to the class discussion."
In organizing and delegating the daily lab tasks [name] identified the strengths of all lab members and used them to assign the most suitable task to each member.
"In our meetings about the Nutrition and Food Safety project, we brainstormed on different ideas and use the different perspectives from our team to create the most effective learning modules. We also evaluated the different methods of evaluation and registration, including which forms of data would be most helpful to me when writing my thesis."
"In our UPIC site visit, it was important for me to tell the coordinator the many things we have accomplished as a research team. Talking about the WRAPPED data analysis, talking about the proposals we have written and the fellowship applications we have written. It was also important for me to say the importance of the work we have done, because we have touched raw data that can help engineering students in SC. And it is important for me to communicate that to people."
In our weekly group meetings with [name]'s grad students each week s.o. would present his current research. [Name] always encouraged but also questioned them in order to improve their research.
"In our weekly meetings and journals, employees were encouraged to share ideas or feedback that could help improve aspects of CB+D's atmosphere, workflow or finish certain projects."
In our weekly meetings we regularly had heated discussion as to what direction the video would take. These discussions were always very respectful and productive and we were able to compromise every time as to the direction we should take.
In our weekly Monday meeting my teammates would come up with creative ideas and i always respected them and gave credit when they were due. If i could add and make a better suggestion I did so but never discredited their ideas.
"In our weekly update meetings [mentor], my UPIC mentor, shows leadership by taking the groups task of creating an online platform for the lab and expressing both his opinion on what is best and being open to receive ideas from all involved."
"In Task Force meetings, I worked alongside my fellow Task Force members to solve difficult problems in a short amount of time. We had to be quick on our feet with innovative ideas given a limited budget. I sometimes helped steer discussions by providing a student perspective to the conversation, and I frequently encouraged outside input as well so that I wasn't the only voice in the room."
"In the Alper lab, my research as direct connections to several other projects that are going on in the lab; these serve to branch biology with physics. In particular, I work alongside a colleague named [name] who is working on creating an optical tweezer that can be used for experimentation. Eventually the proteins that I purify will be placed within this system. Since we come from such different backgrounds, often time our approach to the same issue can be very different. In these instances, it is critical that we discuss all of our options, decide which plan suits our goals best, and which is the best way to achieve this goal in a timely and satisfactory manner. Together, we can coordinate our efforts in order to ultimately achieve our research goal of using a physical construct to obtain biological information."
In the beginning of the semester we set smart goals and periodically throughout the semester we would check them. Now that finals are approaching I created an excel sheet so that they can see what they need to do in order to reach that goal or if the goal can even be met.
"In the beginning stages of the Raspberry Pi project dealing with the room temperature the first step was to discuss the requirements needed in achieving the goal. In that preliminary discussion, I wanted to quickly create some path for every group member to start on as a means of having some direction so I offered to discuss what parts we would need to buy, how often we would need to work on the project, and everyone's availability. In addition to this, I offered to buy hardware for common use in order to test ideas that dealt with the progress of the project."
"In the biweekly meeting, everyone was encouraged to say good things or bad things during the work of the past few weeks."
"In the classroom, I noticed my mentor working with a group of four students. She was helping them complete their maths. She gave them the directions and assisted them when necessary. The students were able to ask questions and the teacher gave productive feedback. Ultimately, they all finished the maths problems and turned in their assignments. The students demonstrated an understanding of the material during a lesson later in the day."
"In the Immersive Space we have different classes come in, and one class is the vr systems cs class with their group projects, and I worked with a group who was stuck for a bit and undecided on the path they were going to take, and I helped work out the issues and provide them info on what other groups had done, and facilitated conversation and helped to push their ideas in a different, better direction than what they were heading, and this further communication and discussion allowed them to figure out their new objective and get their project completed."
In the Makerspace I have led many of our team meetings. I was able to divest some of these responsibilities this year and make sure that other members of the team could take over - helping us identify future leadership.
"In the Makerspace, we are always working to balance the agendas of multiple teams and individuals. Since we have a limited number of equipment, students are often competing for the use of this equipment. I have worked with students to have them combine their prints onto a single job to allow for better use of the machines. I have worked to balance the needs of different students and groups. This has trained me to balance the needs of multiple different groups and people and maximize the efficiency of the space so that everyone benefits."
"In the office, all of the interns help out with tasks related to football weekends. We delegate those tasks each home football game weekend and try to complete them the Thursday before the game. We all understand how important every detail is and know that if our work is thorough, then our donors will want to keep coming back to the football games."
"In the office, the department would have people nominate their coworkers for various accomplisments throughout the past month as well as honor those who have had the most donor visits or asks. I saw how the office celebrates different types of successes, personal, employees helping others, and going the extra mile as well as successes in the office."
"In the process of developing the Farm Days plan, we met with the staff of the Bart Garrison Agricultural Museum of SC to develop the plans. During this, I worked to encourage everyone to share the ideas, especially those I had heard my coworkers mention prior and I thought would be great ideas to implement for the event. Though I was not strictly in charge of the meeting, I knew the successful sharing of all the available ideas would be greatly beneficial to a success event and made sure to lead the discussion towards this beneficial sharing."
"In the yearly water consortium held in Clemson this year, stakeholders form a multitude of government organizations came together to discuss ways to improve water quality across the upstate of South Carolina. I helped lead this program and facilitated the combination and change of information."
"In this internship, there were many nights spent working third shift. Occasionally, the other interns would become tired and not want to perform the work they should have been. I would take that opportunity to remind them of the importance of our work, and it helped us be successful in reaching our goals. We then presented our work to the project lead through a PowerPoint, and he was impressed with our teamwork and accomplishments."
In training this semester I had to speak infront of my peers and tell them the importance of what we do here in Aspire.
"Inspired by some of the tools that we found at AMECO, we acquired a large 50 mm combination wrench that we determined would be a neat way to award the project group that we deemed to be the hardest working group among all of the groups in CEDC. Concrete Testing, the project group that reported to me, was an extremely productive and effective group and were lead by a great project manager. We decided to begin ""The Wrench"" award this semester and by awarding this group ""The Wrench"" at the end of the semester, we saw that recognizing and awarding hard work and leadership would inspire other groups to do the same."
"Instead of assigning me and the other 2 interns with projects to do, [name] laid out 3 main projects that she needed done in the beginning of the semester and allowed us to chose the ones that fit best with our strengths."
Interacted with workers during the internship and learned from their experience about the challenges and their recommendations on process improvements
It is necessary for my fellow teammates to discuss the major observations they have made during the data collection and figure out the top 3 important cases of the week and highlight it during the managers meeting. It has provided me a good chance to encourage the teammates to express their points of view.
It is pivotal to get feedback from others so that I can design to meet everyone's needs not just one.
"It was a common occurrence that myself or one of my coworkers would run into a challenge in Revit, our drafting and modeling software (technically BIM software, or building information model). We would typically discuss a solution based off of everyone's own experiences, because in most cases somebody else has already come across the problem at hand. Once, I was trying to figure out a certain way to model something, so I asked a few coworkers around me for their opinions and we were able to discuss and share our opinions for approaching the challenge. In the end, we had the same goal, but there are often multiple ways to reach that goal. I feel that I was able to keep our discussion productive and on track for our goal of solving the difficulty. And we did!"
"It was a common role in the Makerspace to get students working on a project together on the laser cutter. It was often my role to help them understand how the laser cutter works in a design aspect and how to get the best results. However sometimes the decisions were just design based and there was no right or wrong, just what the group preferred. i was happy to be a part of these conversations and encourage them to talk it out and see what they liked better!"
"It was my personal goal this internship to promote mental health awareness. I did this by having my menses tell me what they did every week for self care/ for themselves. I also opened up to my WISE staff about having and eating disorder and how important it is to look out for that within the menses because it is so common among college age girls, especially engineers who are under loads of stress."
It was one day when all of the interns were in the office for their scheduled work hours and one student was trying to get different perspectives on an idea that they had. They took all of our options into account to create a final opinion.
"It's not a specific time, but, throughout my internship I observed my leader utilizing skills of individuals of various backgrounds to meet company goals."
"[Mentor] had all of her interns meet with her as a group at least once a week. In these meetings, [mentor] would praise us for what we did well and give us ways we could improve. On top of that, she asked our opinions about different issues to come to conclusions about Inside Clemson. We were given the chance to put our two cents into discussions rather than just being told what to do. By working together, we could come to better conclusions than just having [mentor] tell us what she thought about those issues. She really valued our opinions in those meetings and it was incredibly empowering."
"[Name], who is the newest member of the compliance team, showed her worth by putting in more work and vouching for herself than anyone else in the office."
"Just as mentioned above I have worked at my hometown since the summer prior to my sophomore year of high school. I am now headboard, manager on duty, head trainer, swim coach, and swim lesson instructor. I have to work well with my co-workers, show them respect and delegate efficiently. Especially as during high school, many do not want to put in the extra effort to efficiently do their job, I must make sure that I lead properly in order to maintain the work environment and get work don't well without creating a hostile environment. I have initiated a lot of events as well as changes regarding staffing and training."
"Just the other day, I was helping with a volunteer opportunity that was brought to my attention through work and got to meet some partners and individuals iMAGINE has a great working relationship with. I was able to see how they brought the group together and would ask questions to others that were thoughtful and got the others engaged by answering and thinking about answers."
"knew how to carry out tasks when it was expected of me, and was able to lead others throughout the tasks if they did not understand"
[Name] worked tirelessly to put on the first coffee house and shuttled all around Clemson and Anderson to get catering and make sure everything was right. This showed dedication and helped us achieve our first successful event.
[Name] showed immense leadership when starting the development of our innovated evaluation system when we all got together to meet on the next steps to make it actually happen
"Last semester, I attended the CECAS Donors Event on behalf of the PEER/WISE Department. Many of the people in attendance were donors to the PEER/WISE Department and I was able to share the positive impact the department has had on me during my time at Clemson and how much I enjoy being able to impact others in a similar manner."
Lead a team
Lead and organized sewer inspections with contractors to more efficiently get the job done
Lead group discussions within the accelerator to develop the ideas of others to help them achieve their own personal goals as well as our overall intern goal of becoming successful ambassadors of the Spiro Institute.
Lead others to work for the completion of the project
Lead projects and helped lead training
Lead the electrical part of the asssessment.
"Leadership can be a tricky thing. Leaders need to be different things in different places. In Haiti, being a leader means you understand that your team is already uncomfortable/adapting to a new environment and you need to be there for them while also adjusting yourself also"
"Leadership is a big part of my role as intern. For example, I lead an information session on group fitness classes for the orientation ambassadors. I lead over 40 ambassadors through a workout and had them work together as a team to finish it."
"Leadership is not just taking responsibility for large projects, it is being a leader everyday. I feel that I exemplified this by taking charge everyday of the work assigned to me and then going above and beyond to complete that work."
"Leadership is sometimes a hard role to perform when working as an intern. Regardless of the challenges, it is important to show that you are able to perform your tasks without being watched over constantly. During my internship, I had to take partial leadership of overseeing the TigerSTEPS program. I had to make decisions on how the program would be ran, along with decisions on specific cases. If there were thing that I thought could be improved upon it was up to me to bring that up to the others who also were working on TigerSTEPS with me. As an intern, I had to act as a leader and make my own decisions, while also checking in with a supervisor. This is a unique opportunity because if I was unsure of something I had people to go to for help. While leadership isn't my best competency, it has improved, but there is still plenty of room for growth."
"Leadership is the area I think I gained the most this semester. I was often training other interns in the production room to create different types of jobs. I was able to teach other interns different things the computers could do, the best techniques for sign mounting, canvas building, printing, and laminating."
Leadership wasn't needed. I worked mainly by myself
Leading alignment meetings for the Swimlane Diagrams caused the participants to communicate and understand eachother's goals and objectives.
Leading the development for the ccpd app.
Led projects and assignments for completion
Led the project of integrating PPCR into Windchill
Led the team in the absence of my mentor in important issues related to issues central to our team.
Like I said before when I was running the parlor it was my job to be the leader from setup to take down I was in charge so I had to be able to communicate and demonstrate leadership qualities and be the person others looked up to for advice and experience.
"Like I said before, I have led multiple project while interning in the IT Department. This has allowed me use leadership skills to foster collaboration and achieve the results we need to accomplish our task."
"Like I said earlier, I had to work with other process engineers and develop experiments that are good for the future of the company and the advancement of scientific knowledge."
"Many mentors had different approaches to initially reaching out to their mentees. At one point, I was curious to whether a particular approach had been successful, and during a team meeting I asked the group about it and what their experiences with it had been in order to determine if I should attempt this method as well."
"Many of the conversations I had with the professors and students in the Creative Inquiry program that I was interviewing for each Decipher article, I had to discuss some interesting topics like why these students and that professor decided to get into the research they did. I was given the opportunity to hear about personal stories that helped inspire these people. I was also able to see and understand why research itself can be tricky and controversial in some instances, for example, one professor I interviewed discussed how her research method was not supported by other researchers because they didn't think it was an appropriate way to go about gathering information specific to her project. However, she told me that although you might have critics, it's important to express your opinion and engage in express different points of view."
"Many of the other student workers would ask me what there was today, and we would all work together to accomplish goals. Each employee has a special talent when it came to jobs that would utilize their potential we were sure to put them on that job."
"Many of the people of the lab have specialized skills, be it Unity, design, or circuit design. To finish projects as efficiently as possible, projects are divided among the team based on their strengths. The original concept art will be done by one person, and then built and finalized by a pair of others."
Many time when I had a post idea I would go and ask for diffrent perspective on the idea to help me develop the full post.
"Many times my site leader will gather myself along with the other interns and discuss plans for projects that we are working on, such as the Be Brilliant series, helping with convocation, coaching and other jobs in order for us to see the end goal, and ultimately working as a team to do so."
"Many times we have large lists of things to do before a seminar or trial. This can be overwhelming when there are only 2 or 3 people working at a time, but consistently we all gather together and discuss who is best at what and work to people's strengths, while trying to teach the others these tasks so they can accomplish them later on. We, in a sense, divide and conquer the huge list of tasks that need to be done and all continue to learn new things along the way."
"Me and a coworker were working together on a project, and we both had to be on the same page and achieve this shared vision by working together and making clear of what we both thought would work best for the job."
Met deadlines
"[Name] and [another name] created content for the college on a regular basis, telling the stories of staff members and students. Being able to tell the stories of individuals who share different beliefs, values, and goals is important for showcasing what each individual offers to Clemson. They are strong communicators and leaders."
"[Mentor] is the mentor for two UPIC interns, I do the graphics and [name] does videography for the office. At the beginning of the semester he did a good job of introducing us and helping us get to know each other better. He is really good about recognizing our strengths and knowing what projects to give us."
Milking
"Ministry leader [mentor] knew how to pull out the talents in her staff and interns. [Mentor] recognized the musical and teaching gifitngs of our administrator and gently called upon her to use them, pulling her just outside her comfort zone for the growth of the person and the ministry. It was really neat to see."
Monthly there was a one on one lunch with the mentor of the company to access my work and also the company's work with the internship. I provided valuable inputs to assist them in making changes for making the work of interns more efficient.
"Most of the time, I challenge employees to not sit still and to stay active. Sometimes, I would ""break"" things on purpose just to see if the team could solve the issues. Other times, I would lead by example, always looking for things to do and never being complacent."
Most of the work is done in the testing area and are done individually.
"[Mentor] constantly recognizes and capitalizes on the unique strengths of [name], an Engineering who works in the PEER/WISE study hall."
"Multiple new employees starting working in the Study Abroad Office this semester and my mentor, [mentor], did a great job respecting their strengths as they began working together throughout the semester."
"My actual assignment during my internship was to be an assistant to the coordinator of outreach. The coordinators job is to plan the outreach events from start to finish. She takes the ideas of events and makes them into real events for the surrounding high schools. As her assistant, I often filled in fo her when she could not be present, delegating tasks and creating dialogues with individuals from different departments to improve the programs for the future."
My adviser was debugging a fault and immediately assigned emergency responsibilities to analyze various parameters responsible for the fault
My advisor combined me with another student in our office to create drop-in hours and other information sessions for students. We were placed together because her program and my program (CISabroad) have very similar trips to Australia and New Zealand that allowed us to inform students on both our programs. This also helped get other students thinking about studying abroad even if it wasn't through our two programs.
"My belief is that a leadership comes in many forms, and that everyone's definition of leadership varies. Often people associate leadership with position, but in reality, that is not necessarily true. Just because I serve as an intern, I can still demonstrate leadership qualities. Several times this semester, I have been able to lead the group of interns in the office to achieve a common goal. I served as the communications director for the Study Abroad Ambassadors, and through that position I was able to coordinate and execute a plan for the ""It's not too late to study abroad"" campaign. By assigning individual action items for each team member and creating a check-off sheet for all of them to achieve those tasks let to a more productive work environment and a successful attempt to exceed our study abroad numbers from last spring."
My boss always conducts meetings every Monday at 9:30 to review our goals for the previous week and discussing our goals for the upcoming week.
My boss is a good leader and understands peoples backgrounds and how they work. Some of the people in my department work better alone so he is understanding and allows them to go work where they are most productive.
My boss [mentor] has shown me the path to being great mentor by just the way she treats the ones around the office.
My boss often headed projects and was good at communicating what needed to be done.
"My boss [mentor] is an incredible leaders, she handles the business development side of Trinity Sport. This includes camps, bookings, social media, promotions, and membership so she has lots to look after. She has a team of employees and interns that she is responsible for and does a wonderful job empowering each of us and delegating work efficiently and smartly. I have been watching her keenly to learn from her leadership skills each time we have a team project."
My boss was having a hard time developing the pesticide license exam and she called in an inspector and I got to see them first hand work together. They used their backgrounds to build an exam that would cover the important topics and make it moderately challenging.
"My boss, being a German-American, often had to recognize and respect the unique strengths of individuals from all backgrounds."
My current mentor is new and she did a very good job transitioning in and getting to know all of us well so that we may work efficiently and comfortably together.
"My department works with a company TransVoyant, to foresee exactly what shipments there are flying to South Africa and China. I was fortunate to build a relationship with TransVoyant and work out problems on both sides to form a better partnership."
"My direct report was [mentor], a guardianship clerk. She directed all of the interns during various projects in order to improve the efficiency of the probate court."
"My entire internship centered around my ability to encourage discussion among individuals (mainly professors). One particular story that pertains to this interview question is my meeting with [name] (professor and chair of the materials science and engineering department) at the beginning of the semester. I explained to him my intentions of getting the entire department involved in the updating of content on the website and he agreed that this would be the most effective way of creating a better webpage for the department. After our meeting, he sent out an email to every professor in the department asking if anyone had relevant content or suggestions on how to make the website better as well as my contact information. This created a platform for professors and other members of the department to get in contact with me to voice their opinions and communicate relevant information."
My experience with ARCADIS taught me that anyone could be a leader. The responsibility I was given strengthened my self-confidence and improved the quality of my output. That response made me a better team member and a better worker in all aspects of my life.
My first semester as an intern -Didn't really have any leadership responsibilities -Just getting to know the people and the facility and how things are run
"My host/supervisor in the company is the team lead for this project and I observed how he coordinated with full time employees and other interns in order to combine all the individual knowledge, skills, background and tasks in such a way that in totality the project turns out to be a success."
"My internship did not entail a lot of leadership roles, however, I was very lucky to be able to work alongside many great leaders throughout my time at IPTAY. One great example would be our CEO, [name]. Most of my interactions with [name] came from our Monday morning staff meetings. He was very effective in making sure that every voice in the room was heard (including mine), and took viewpoints from all different departments and backgrounds and into consideration when any kind of debate was going on. He always had a way of asking the right questions to get the most out of an idea or a topic, and knew how to balance differing opinions in order to reach the best possible conclusion for the group."
My internship was all online so I did not see much leadership or discussion. My mentor was very supportive for me.
"My internship was based less in sharing ideas than in completing tasks as necessary. Our shared vision was to promote the University, and we had to do that in every aspect of our job. Occasionally that goal was hard to achieve. For instance, we had to run a story about the director of parking services, and we had to debate whether or not to portray him in a good light (leaving out the outrage over parking on campus), or to be honest about the way that parking services needs to improve to meet the needs of students and faculty. This discussion had to be open and everyone had to share their views. In the end, honesty won out."
"My job here was usually a one man job if I was not collaborating with other groups. In collaboration, leadership was required to get the job done and make sure I that what I am creating is what they want."
My leadership skills have improved greatly over the past semester. I have become more confident with corrective action. I was able to talk to students and let them know what mistakes they have made and I was able to avoid conflict.
"My leadership wasn't showcased necessarily in a group setting, considering we never had group projects with other coworkers. My leadership was more showcased in my ability to be reliable and communicate. Getting assignments done in a timely manner and communicating updates frequently."
My manager lead her team in discussions about hiring another intern for the next semester. Some people in the group had differing opinions on who they should hire. My manager took everyone's opinions seriously and discussed each candidates merits. She eventually led them to a consensus and selected the intern to hire for next semester.
My manager often had to instruct coworkers and me on what to do if he had to step away. He had to be clear so that we knew what to do.
"My mentor and I communicated with the alumni association prior to the 100th anniversary in order to get ideas from them for our banners. We contributed our ideas, and I contributed mine and was open to change. We ended up taking what they had recommended and further exploring ideas with Campus Banner and Design."
"My mentor and I started the summer with 1:1 meetings every week and we more recently started including one of the graduate assistants (whom I've worked and communicated with most after my mentor) in our weekly meetings. In these meetings, my mentor is able to lead the meeting very well by opening with questions about our lives as a little warm-up, and she asks individual questions referencing specific things that she remembers about each of us. She then continues to mostly speak with me, since the GA's main purpose in the meetings is to shadow, and she makes me feel very comfortable with how she speaks, asks questions, and provides feedback on my projects."
My mentor assigned individual tasks to all the interns so that we could complete projects as efficiently as possible.
My mentor constantly provided this positive feedback for me in my internship
My mentor definitely exhibited leadership throughout this semester by being able to lead our AOD team in the incentives push for the NCHA. Each of us had a significant role to play because we each had numerous connections. She effectively delegated tasks to us to do.
MY MENTOR GAVE ME THAT FEEDBACK TOWARDS THE END OF THE INTERN AND I LOOK FORWARD TO IMPROVE.
"My mentor had asked me to begin a layout for the Watt Center Annual Report, and we went back and forth with different ideas we had for color templates and infographics. I continually asked for feedback from her and from my other co-workers and encouraged them to contribute ideas as well so I could achieve a cohesive design that pleased everyone."
My mentor has always called out great work done by her coworkers. They all praise each other and support one another.
My mentor has once take me a meeting with clients to talk about requirements and specifications for the website they need. The clients often have an idea of what they want and the theme of what it should be. However they also do not understand exactly the technology and difficulty needed to design what they want. The mentor need to guide the clients on what we can or cannot do while trying to follow their requirements the best he can.
"My mentor is especially good at capitalizing on my strengths and recognizing things that I should work on. She has given me several tasks she knew I could do but would challenge me. But on the other hand she has also given me tasks, like making quick edits to our logo when a sponsor needs specific dimensions or a transparent background or a different file type. She is able to recognize that asking someone else will take time where as I'm available and can get things back to her quickly. [Name], the director, has also been able to capitalize on my strength of having an artistic eye and being a perfectionist. Whenever she is creating marketing material, she asks me to look at it and make adjustments to format, colors, fonts, arrangement, text, etc."
My mentor is good at seeing people's strengths and weaknesses and putting them in a position they excel in rather than struggle.
"My mentor is involved in managing several enterprises so he was often out at other businesses or in meetings. Due to this I sometimes assisted staff on the retail floor by interacting with customers and answering inquiries. During one of these days I noticed that the layout of our travel section, sunhats, hydration section, and socks were not organized efficiently. Myself and two other staff members moved the stock around to make it easier for customers to find the travel and hydration offerings due to them being popular and a large source of revenue. Although we made them more visible by moving them more towards the center of the customer's view of the store they also were moved back. This meant the customer had to pass most of the products on the ground floor to get to the product they were looking forward. We hoped this would increase the chances of a product catching a customer's eye."
My mentor is the acting manager of the Architectural design team and she is incredible in leading the team to complete a shared goal in a timely manner. I gained many leadership skills from her and it encourages me to take on more leadership positions.
My mentor [mentor] does a good job of playing on each of our strengths but also challenging us to work on our weaknesses.
"My mentor makes sure to emphasize the strengths of myself and my coworker, [name]. She gives us projects that are a good fit for us personally and utilizes our unique skills. For example, she will give [name] a project that is more graphically oriented and give me one that is more written."
"My mentor [mentor] actively points his interns towards jobs that are more towards their strengths. For instance, I'm better at coding than working at hardware, so I'm usually given the coding projects for the semester."
My Mentor showed great leadership in how she helped me throughout this internship.
My mentor showed leadership in coordinating radioactive waste pickups from the labs on campus and in the research park. He assigned specific duties to specific employees and ensured everyone performed their duties safely and responsibly.
"My mentor [mentor] has to communicate with all people within the department on a daily basis because she handles so much of the administrative work. It seems like it can be challenging at times, because there are language and culture barriers, as well as age barriers. She caters to all of this and is mindful of all of it as a leader"
My mentor used great leadership skills utilizing her interns in effective ways to get projects done. She would draw on the strengths of each intern and put them in roles to capitalize on the skills and knowledge they had. There were many opportunites in the workplace for us to excel in something that we had talent in.
"My mentor was a great leader and got different people together all the time. For every marketing campaign we did, she brought together people who had different strengths to complement each other."
My mentor was the boss for the team so I got to watch him organize the team and act as a leader.
"My mentor, [mentor] who is the manager for Final Assembly and Final Test has to manage operators, supervisors, engineers, interns and also his relationship with the higher management. He is direct, effective, and values every small contribution from every possible source at his dispense."
"My mentors worked with me to find my strengths. As my internship is physics heavy, I am not familiar with a lot of the terminology, but I do take an interest in the health physics side of it, so my mentors took the time to talk to me about the health physics side of my internship."
My portion of the pecan workshop gave the participants knowledge of how to identify and treat the problems they may face with their pecan trees. I presented them with research based information that would allow them to produce more pecans each year and keep their trees healthy. This aligns with the Extension goal of providing the community with information that improves their lives.
"My primary project was the design and development of a modular shelving system meant to hold electrical cables for rapid and easy testing. This project required coordinating the requirements of the testing engineers, the engineers who's parts were to be tested, and the fabricators who would be building the shelf. The key to this endeavor was keeping in constant communication with each party to ensure that everyone's needs were being met and everyone was on the same page."
"My project lacked focus for a good part of the internship. However, I have eventually taken the initiative and convinced others to accept my vision."
"My responsibility includes answering emails for all the users that using this open source product -- indeed lot of people ask vague questions -- rather than immediately start to answer those vague questions, To lead the conversation, I'd like to provide them meaningful information of this product, in order to help us to converge to one or two specific questions. Sometimes I'll ask them the reason why they want to do a certain thing, or sometimes I'll just ask them for more information, etc. Then based on the their goal, I will provide the capability for the open source product. If we find some agreement, then we'll dig through it to shape a solution/idea."
"My site mentor often times led the meetings and helped steer them into the right direction when it came to achieving their goals of the meeting, whether that was just talking about an upcoming event or learning how to edit a website."
"My site mentor, [mentor], did a great job of recognizing the different strengths of myself and [name] when planning and preparing for our weekly informational videos. She recognized that I had an ease with being on camera and communicating with people, while [name] was superb at the editing and formatting of the videos, wherein I struggled. Under her guidance we were able to most efficiently conquer the task at hand."
"My story for this one is a bit of a touchy topic with my department, and I cannot take full credit for how the situation came about, or how it was handled. At the beginning of the semester, I began hearing discussions/complaints between coworkers regarding compensation. At first, I didn't feel this was a serious issue, but as time went on, more and more people mentioned this to me, my counterpart ([name]), and another coworker (will remain nameless). After we had a full operations staff meeting one night, the three of us sat down with our new supervisor and discussed the issue of several very skilled staff members feeling they were being underpaid for the work they do, and were considering seeking employment elsewhere. After hours of discussion, my coworker felt it was best to create a group chat with all that felt they were underpaid, and added [name] and me to it as well. In this group chat, everyone was encouraged to express their opinions, why they felt the way that they did, and what they felt would be the best solution. [Name] and I, who work closely with our full-time staff members facilitated the questions and assured everyone that their concerns were being heard, even if they felt nothing was being done about it. While all of this was going on, our supervisor was working on finding a short term solution to ease the tension while other full-time staff work on finding a more long-term solution. At the end of the day, I feel the group chat was a great way to ease tension and make people feel like they were actually being listened to while a solution was worked out."
"My supervisor call all the people to form a team to work on projects together and based on his leadership, everyone have their own role and task and work together for the same goal."
My supervisor and other colleagues worked on different aspects of the same project and got done with multiple projects in just 2 months .
My supervisor assigned different works to different co-workers according to their background and expertise. Some of them are experts in programming while others are doing well in algorithm design. The synergy made our work efficiency better.
My supervisor brought together students from various majors and social groups to develop a plan for getting students more involved at Brooks.
"My supervisor developed a team of 6 people including me and another intern to make a new physical model for the project, but at the same time he still need to coordinated with the builder and client to check the progress of construction."
My supervisor does a great job on drawing on the different strengths of me and her other intern. We are able to divide different projects and jobs based on our strengths.
My supervisor does that and he macro manages his teams to meet company goals regularly.
"My supervisor gave each project to employees based on their best skills. Some projects, like the highly technical baseball projects, were better completed by students that already had a background in baseball and were familiar in terminology. Other projects, like the Fanatics sales project, were better completed by students that had a business and marketing background. Accounting for the diverse backgrounds of students helped each project to be as successful as possible."
"My supervisor had to speak about what PEER WISE is and does to students and parents at the event that we hosted. Instead of giving them exactly what PEER WISE does, she had each student that works in the PEER WISE office as a mentor, a tutor, or an assistant come up to the stage to speak about how PEER WISE has impacted them and helped them as a student at Clemson."
My supervisor [mentor] is a great example of a wonderful leader that encourages everyone to be the best employee they can. She explained things in a way that everyone understood and she made sure to take the time to explain something if I didn't understand. She was always willing to listen to everyone's opinions and ideas on future social content and promotions. I can't thank her enough for being such a wonderful example of the leader I hope to be one day. And words will never describe how grateful I am for this wonderful opportunity.
"My supervisor is in charge of helping start-up new extension programs and she works with other people, programs and businesses in order to start a new extension program and to find out what needs to be done to the existing programs."
My supervisor is the team lead for this project and I saw how he brought together other employees in his team and the interns he hired to bring the best out of everyone to make meaningful contribution all the while making sure we as interns also learnt from this project.
"My supervisor manages four of us interns, and she does a great job at assigning us projects based on our interests and skill-sets. Also because I have been in my position for a year, I have been able to have more responsibility in directing and delegating new interns to complete projects or provide instructions."
My supervisor [mentor] helped me multiple times with projects that I had messed up on. I had a big problem with learning the steps of production and mastering the production processes. [Mentor] was always there to help and fix whatever I had messed up on.
"My supervisor organized me into a group with another person working on a different project than me, so that we could both get experience and learn from each other."
"My supervisor oversees all interns. She tracks each projects' progress and support interns in their interaction with research experts. Since the Research-to-Policy Collaboration works on an array of social issues, interns have the opportunity to choose to work on a topic that they already feel passionate about or one that they've been wanting to explore but haven't had the chance; a topic of which they are experts or one that they want to learn about. She gives room for the interns to explore the topics and tasks while also supporting them throughout the process."
My supervisor recognized the strengths of each student and professional on a daily basis and tailored the day's goals on the given volunteers abilities. One time we had two dentists volunteer at an elementary school and I was given the task of sanitizing the equipment.
My supervisor saw some potential in me to be good at UPS sales so he reassigned me to that in February.
My supervisor [mentor] consistently kept up with how each one of her employees were doing personally and with their work. Her leadership created a fun and efficient work environment.
My supervisor took benefit of my programming skills to create innovative software which documents data during failures and aids debugging
My supervisor would connect me with other videographers and people from other organizations that we would be working with. He would introduce us and describe what the end goal was.
My supervisor would go through my summaries with a fine tooth comb to hone my writing skills.
"My supervisor, [mentor], does a great job at being a leader. She is a great example of what a leader should be like. She encourages all of us when we have a creative idea and is quite flexible and understanding. During our group meetings she allows us all to speak and be part of the dialogue."
"My supervisor, [mentor], Lead our group of PEER mentors every week at staff meetings. And I particularly remember her leading the group towards improving the organization by encouraging us to Lead committees within PEER that would enhance our visibility on campus throughout the semester."
"My supervisor, [mentor], displayed excellent leadership skills when we had to install a tv monitor in Vickery hall and also run cabling through a table. He instructed the team on how to do each task and was able to answer questions when somebody was confused as to how something should be solved. For instance, when installing the first tv monitor it wouldn't mount to the wall well and as a team we solved it together. [Mentor] then took note of this and applied it to other buildings on campus when the same kind of monitor would be installed."
My two coworkers constantly disagreed and so throughout the internship I turned into a mediator for the two of them and was able to re-align our objectives to get back on track.
My work got nominated to be presented at Tuscan intern conference where only few interns get the chance to present there.
"My work team holds weekly meetings to handle business of the lab, regular project updates and discuss new discoveries in the field. This meeting has allowed me to spark open and honest discussion between my coworkers about the projects that we are working on."
Myself and my fellow intern were put in charge of a project of lowering manure moisture. At one point during the project we set up a meeting with between ourselves and our boss and supervisor. In this meeting I encouraged all of us to share ideas to figure out a way to move the project forward. Certain members were stuck on points of the project but having multiple perspectives was useful in allowing us to move forward.
"Near the beginning of my internship, I was pushing for the creation of an Instagram account to better reach Clemson students. I knew that our department had tried and failed to have an account a few years earlier, so I reached out to my mentor and his boss to have a meeting discussing the pros and cons of creating and instagram, as well to create a defined outline of what we wanted our CCIT brand to be. Through the discussion of our varying ideas, we came up with a plan to meet our common goals as a department."
"Near the end of my semester I attending the club sports Leadership Series community service night. My mentor, [mentor], organized this event for all of the club sports captains and presidents to attend. A speaker then came to talk to the group about how their individual skill sets can be used to make a difference in the community. After the speaker, the group was lead in multiple service projects, requiring them all to work together, but also put their personal touch on these projects. It was cool to see how my mentor, just one person, was able to put this whole event together which helped teams help others."
Nearly every day my mentor and I discussed different points of views on our website. Specifically we would talk about different ways to implement our resources page. We both came to a conclusion of a mixture of both of our ideas because that would better suit the website and make it more effective at its purpose.
"New employee training offers a ton of leadership experience. Some concepts you have to really explain so that employees can learn good troubleshooting habits, but some duties can be explained broadly. Also for this, I feel that you have to develop your own training style based on what has worked before and what has not worked. I used past manager guidelines to develop my training style which is more employee driven, after initial information has been given. With training, you can also see which employees pick up concepts quicker than others which usually results in good manager candidates and/or special event technicians."
"Not in this rotation, but in my previous rotation, I was given the opportunity to lead a group of high school students from around the country for a week in our facility to learn about electron microscopy. I was encouraged them to talk about what they could do together to solve some of the problems we gave them."
Not very much as an intern.
Often during meetings with other interns or mentors we would have differing ideas about what we should do for certain events and we needed to work together in order to come up with solutions to these issues.
Often I was given projects that required collaboration and discussion before I decided upon the final product. When I was faced with creating the brochures I brought them up in a meeting and chose to ask opinions and create a discussion about what was most important or vital to be included and what could go.
"Often times during the internship it was very important for me to rely messages and orders from my mentor and other superiors to the volunteers and students that were working under me. As mentioned above this was especially true during Strike, when I was directly responsible for a group of workers as well as responsible for delegating a large amount of work among others."
"Often times in our team meetings, we would all contribute on certain issues and provide a different view on how to solve certain issues, such as people not signing in or logging their 3D printed parts. We would all offer different ideas from each other."
"Often times in our weekly meetings with our head supervisor. A lot of information would be presented and there were several different comments, suggestions, and feedback that was provided in order to help the colleague. I believe that our head supervisor did a good job reaching out to different people as he knew their strengths and weaknesses and was able to highlight on them, in order to help me."
"On couple of occasions, I came up with some plans which were different from what my mentor was envisaging, and those ideas were slightly more far sighted. Also, my mentor appreciated those plans."
"On couple of occasions, I came up with some plans which were different from what my mentor was envisaging, and those ideas were slightly more far-sighted. Also, my mentor appreciated those plans."
"On Monday, November 26, 2018, I hosted (along with the other Clemson Abroad LdM intern) an LdM specific orientation session for students traveling to LdM in Spring 2019. During this session, the other LdM intern and I greatly empowered these students by providing our own helpful tips and experiences during our own semesters abroad in Florence, and we allowed the students to better understand that our successful times abroad could also be theirs next semester."
"On my recent project, I would put on the project to help another UPIC intern with flow cytometry. I did not know what flow cytometry was prior to the project because it is not apart of my major, but my supervisor believed I could do the prep work and analysis of it. My supervisor saw skills I did not know I possess and allowed me to develop them throughout the semester."
"On one occasion, I was sent with other interns to lead a large group of volunteers to clean a school. We were to meet them there and spearhead the project. I met with school administration to find out what needed to be done, ad called an intern meeting. With the new information, we discussed how to best divide up the volunteers, who was to lead each smaller group, and what they would be doing. We also decided what supplies to bring with us to the school. Because we had several groups of volunteers with us, we did not initially agree on how to divide them up. I suggested that we split up the groups in order to promote a collaborative atmosphere and build relationships. Our Operations Intern, [name], suggested that we keep a family of volunteers together so that the parents could keep an eye on their kids. To compromise, we decided to split up the other volunteer groups but keep the family together. This worked well, and we ended up finishing early because the groups worked well together."
"On several projects and committees, the WISE Coordinator had to delegate jobs to our staff in ways that all mentors' strengths were recognized."
"On that day that the power went out, [name] had to get us all together and tell us what needed to be done once we found out which computers where actually down."
"On the actual day of Legacy Day, I enlisted the help of my fellow interns to help me cover the event. I had to delegate the work among us and assign each of them specific tasks to do. Without their help, it would have been a very overwhelming day, so I made sure to tell them how much I appreciated having them there."
"On the drive back from adventure trips, I led/ facilitated discussion on what people thought of the experience"
"On the Social Strategy Team we have interns from different departments. A lot of the projects that we do takes a little bit from each department- the writers create a script, the graphics interns make the logos and the introduction clips, and the video interns capture the visual material and make it into a piece to be shared out on social channels. Other times we work together to create Instagram stories as well. Our supervisor does a good job of distributing the work so that each person's talents can really shine."
"Once a week, we had a ""team meeting"" that consisted of myself, my mentor, and my coworker. During this meeting, we would throw out ideas of how to strengthen the social media and Meet A Tiger. We were each able to help each other, connect together verbally and through a plan so that we knew what was expected over the course of the summer."
"Once again, during the retreat, which was my biggest project so that is the reason that I am referencing it so much, the floor was opened for the individuals present to share their feelings about topics discussed. I spoke up many times to encourage others to do so as well."
"Once again, I feel that my leadership quality came through with the Native Planting Workshop. As I mentioned previously, I worked extremely hard to communicate with others and then to bring their accomplishments and their skills to the table in the best way possible. I also worked to share the group's accomplishments the day of the planting to the rest of the office supporters, such as the Extension Administration, and the stakeholders of the golf course, by providing [name] materials to provide to his membership to explain the impact and design of the garden on his course."
"Once again, I helped our nurse practitioners become more organized and efficient by successfully creating multiple templates for [name] (FNP-C) and [name] (FNP-C) ."
"Once again, when I was working on the website, I was one of two student interns that were at Clemson Online. This made me the only person who had the point of view of a student, and I lead the charge on coming up with the best website design and content for the student."
Once every week or so the team would get together for a lunch where my manager would engage everyone and we would talk about the work we are doing and give relevant input to other if and when needed.
Once we were trying to figure out a solution as to why one of our display carts was not working correctly. I suggested every intern present come up with a possible reason for the issue and try to remedy the unit using each of our ideas until we found the solution.
"Once when I observed my supervisor capitalize on the unique strengths of individuals was when she assigned different tasks to several different interns. I am not the only intern within my department and there are about four others who work under my mentor. At one meeting, my mentor called us all together and asked us our interests and strengths to gear us towards the right project for each of us. Instead of randomly assigning us to projects, she made sure that she understood our interests first. She developed a plan for how each of us would be involved in the department."
"Once, another employee needed to make something for the office and he recognized that we had a unique set of skills and the means to 3D print what was needed."
"One challenge we encountered this semester included tasks being left incomplete for extended periods of time. To remedy this, I had a meeting with my stafff where I presented the problem and asked for their opinions and suggestions for improvement. We worked together to find a solution that worked for everyone."
"One day during the semester, some coworkers were feeling a bit lethargic when we needed to complete a room for setup. I empowered them to push through and we ended up setting up the room in a very quick manor."
"One day we were cruising timber, our supervisor recognized that one of the other student interns was specifically good at calling tree height. He used this opportunity to help develop her strength and enable her to practice and become more knowledgeable in calling tree height and using the proper tools to improve that ability."
"One day, all of our supervisors were participating in an OGE training, so there were only interns in the office. I was responsible for maintaining order in the office and making sure that students/parents/outside parties were assisted if they came in. A student from the NC State abroad office called and was conducting a study abroad survey and was collecting quantitative as well as qualitative data from abroad offices across the U.S. I was able to answer his questions and assist in that survey based on my two semesters of experience with the Clemson Abroad office."
"One of my biggest responsibilities at the beginning of the semester was to assign all students into project groups and assign project managers to each group. This required analyzing students' skills and knowledge, and how it could apply to each group in order to determine where they would fit best. Upon assigning project managers, I had to train them and get them up to speed with what their role would require."
"One of my colleagues respected my mentor's 30+ years of experience in technical writing, and even though she didn't always agree with what he was saying, she still heeded his recommendations because she recognized his experience as a technical writer."
One of my coworkers took a lot of the photos for the store and I was able to observe her craft and give my honest opinion. We both had the common goal of posting the new blog post and photo on instagram and we had to collaborate to achieve this. I had a vision of what I wanted the photo to look like and she was the expert photographer. We had different ideas to begin with but used communication to find common ground.
"One of my Co-Workers, [name], teachings about laboratory animals and gives tours of the facility to the students. I observed him doing this on multiple occasions."
"One of my fellow interns immediately took to organizing the intern meetings. He quickly learned about how to develop meeting agendas and has run most of the meetings this year. His leadership has been appreciated, and he always strives to keep our meetings productive."
"One of my first few weeks [name] allowed me to attend, and help direct, one of the quarterly board meetings. There were several important people in attendance and I got my first real insight on how to step in and aid through minor leadership at a board meeting."
"One of my goals for this semester was to create opportunities for the students attending the Business in Paris program to get to know one another before actually arriving in Paris. To do this, I implemented various team building and discussion points throughout the pre-departure orientation sessions where students had to find things in common which would hopefully lead to developing relationships prior to leaving for Paris. This is important because it's comforting to know the people around you before arriving in a foreign place together."
One of my projects during my internship was to mange rework on a part. I had be sure that we stayed focus and met our deadline for the parts.
One of my responsibilities is to train the new ambassadors. I implemented several interactive activities based around practicing conversations and answering questions with prospective students that included group discussions on how to approach difficult subjects or questions that get brought up. We all had the same goal of making sure each of us represent the Honors College and Clemson in the best possible way. My job was to empower them through the activities and providing them the resources necessary so that they were comfortable in achieving this common goal.
One of my roles in project management is to help groups develop a scope and tasklist for their projects. It is important that they consider the role of their group and of CEDC and how their project aligns with the needs of the people of Haiti.
"One of my supervisors started a group dialogue with other heads of departments to determine how they could develop a program that would encourage more study abroad activity from the individual departments. This mainly meant creating a study abroad program that would appeal to students within the department based on location, classes offered, and the living accommodations. They laid out the basic expectations of such a program, and made plans to continue the dialogue in the future."
One of my supervisors utilized another intern for a specific project that involved him to write a script using Python. My supervisor picked this specific intern because of his previous experience in Python; he knew that this intern would write the script effectively.
"One of my supervisors worked with me last week, and I observed him speaking and empowering a much younger employee about their competency with import HTS codes, and praising her for her understanding."
"One of our event planners, [name], lead all of us to understand the idea she had for an event. She met with maintenance and catering so they were all on the same page with set up of the tables and food."
"One of the accomplishment of the Spirit Task Force this semester was the termination of the balloon release at football games. Despite being an extremely wasteful practice, it is something that is important in making the start of our football games the ""most exciting 30 seconds in college football"". It was so important to hear from students that see the value in this practice being a ""tradition"" as well as students who believe that its environmental consequences outweigh showmanship. In the club meeting, we had a constructive dialogue about how to replace the balloons with something equally as exciting that preserves the tradition as well as the environment."
"One of the best examples of leadership I observed this semester as the opening of the Clemson Football Applied Science Lab. Working under the director of facilities, I was able to observe his leadership to develop this building, while also working under him to contribute to the new recovery room. It was really cool to watch a bunch of people come together to achieve the same vision."
"One of the biggest ongoing tasks of the semester was placing an order for padfolios. It was difficult to find a company that was licensed by Clemson and could complete the order under budget. I had to pick the certain padfolio, design what would go on the padfolio, finalize pricing, coordinate shipping efforts, and lastly, place the order. I was responsible for sure the product was ordered and delivered by the time we needed it. I also needed to ensure that the image of it aligned with the brand of the UPIC office."
One of the engineers had to go out of town on office work and left me in charge of a machine re-qualification and I successfully made sure that the machine is moved to its new designated area and it was re-qualified for production.
"One of the Faculty-directed Program Coordinators organized several class visits to spread the word about two new Faculty-Directed Abroad Programs. She organized the class visits, explained the positives of the program to a few of us interns, and lead us to visit classes explaining the programs and also advising students about these programs. She is very passionate about the programs and relayed that to us and had us become advocates for the programs as well."
"One of the initiative's components is the Pathfinder's program which aims to recruit post-doctoral scholars to Clemson. The idea is that they familiarize themselves with Clemson and network to learn what Clemson is all about. Unfortunately, turnout for this recruitment was low. I assisted in determining what the key objective of the program was so that we could determine who the correct points of contacts were within the administration."
"One of the initiative's components is the Pathfinder's program which seeks to recruit post-doctoral fellows to Clemson so that they can network and learn what Clemson is all about. Unfortunately, not much word has been disseminated and applications to this program is low. I assisted in determining what the key objective of the program was so that we could determine who the correct points of contacts were within the administration."
One of the interns [name] was creating a clothing brand called Swiff and he also befriended all of the interns. He got some of them to work together to help him out in creating a mouthguard for his apparel brand. He got someone to design the 3-d model and another person to create the logo for it.
"One of the main leaders that I work with is named [name]. When he works on projects for his team, he often asks those around him for ideas even if he already has an idea of a way something should be done. This is because he respects others opinions and values that their ideas may have a fresh and beneficial outlook on the problem at hand."
One of the major aspects of WISER is helping the girls succeed academically. I made sure my mentees were aware of resources at their disposal and I informed them of several activities/workshops that could be of their service.
"One of the managers I worked with was known for his positive demeanor and hard-work. He consistently praised team members and encouraged them when they performed well on the job. Additionally, he did an excellent job of delegating to his team and empowering people to succeed. I particularly noted some of the actions he would take, such as sending out encouraging emails or brining doughnuts on Fridays, and hope to utilize these team building tactics one day."
One of the older interns was talking to another intern and realized that they had misinterpreted one of the policies so they recognized the problem and then made a note to follow it extra as to lead by example.
"One of the other employees worked closely with us over the course of our major project. He set the goals of the project, and checked in with us along the way to adjust the project goals as we progressed towards the finish."
One of the other interns felt uncomfortable on a microscope that is important in the facility. I went back through training with them and taught them what they needed to know to efficiently run the machine. This has allowed the other intern to help users when they struggle or have a problem.
"One of the other interns, who I consider a good friend, often engaged with me on different styles and methods of completing an assignment. I always took into account that her views were very different from mine, and rather than view that as a weakness or attempt to change her opinions, I'd try to get her unique opinion to help move the design process forward. We would very often collaborate back and forth on designs we completed, asking each other what the other would do differently. If we weren't doing that, we would be sharing techniques on how to get started, what tools to use, or what thought processes we would use to come up with and complete a design. For instance, if we were creating covers for certain magazines, we'd be very open to discuss the emotion our respective covers would invoke, either confirming that said emotion was intended to be invoked, or offering alternatives to create the desired effect. Since we both have a considerable amount of skill in our field, changes we'd make were never too drastic, including a change in the colors we'd use or changing or removing a single element within the document, with little or no protest."
"One of the people I worked with in my internship was formerly a part of the Marines. When there was requests for remarks and introductions to be given by the president at a student veterans event, even though remarks do not typically fall under her job description, [name] took charge of this project because she had the expertise to execute it."
"One of the projects during the semester for Spiro was a video advertising the Spiro Living Learning Community for next year. My supervisor had assigned this task to one of the other interns initially. After a brief discussion between the three of us, my supervisor realized and decided that I would be better equipped to complete this task as I already had experience filming videos. He also pulled another intern onto the project to be in the video because she enjoyed public speaking and lived in the dorms where the LLC would be housed. This resulted in a better overall video and a more enjoyable experience for the interns involved."
"One of the projects I am working on currently is a staff spotlight feature for the upcoming spring semester. In the process of doing so, I have interviewed multiple staff members of the CCPD to get their opinions on different aspects of working there. The goal in the end is to help the students relate better to the staff and encourage more student participation in the center."
"One of the projects I was involved in dealt with developing standardised work instructions for the transmission line, and once I finished the pilot instruction for the first station, I set up a meeting with my manufacturing engineer and the production supervisor to review the instructions. I also asked the production supervisor if it's possible that an operator from the line could join the meeting because ultimately they are the end users of this instructions. And so the operator came in and we got a lot of input from him."
"One of the projects I worked on was with a younger intern putting together binders of published work of physicians at GHS. We all came in thinking about doing the project differently, but I asked the other intern how she wanted to do it and then told her my opinion on what we should do. We each liked something about the other's idea, and met in the middle on what the best path was to complete the task."
"One of the projects we worked on with [name] was applying to research positions. I believe that I helped facilitate an environment where my coworkers could talk to me and to each other about our applications, which often involved writing detailed essays of deeply personal experiences. At the beginning of the semester one of my co-workers was intimidated of me, but by the end, she now comes to me to help her with essay writing. My work with [name] is more solitary, I haven't had the chance to lead anyone except myself in this position."
"One of the social media tactics I really wanted to implement this semester was making the Instagram account more personable and relatable to students. I initiated and led this project by conducting the student and faculty spotlight interviews and promoting those blog articles on the Instagram accounts, so that there would be more pictures of students on the account, rather than just flyers for events. I lead faculty members in this initiative and worked with students who wanted to see the Instagram account be revamped and I am very proud of the way the account is looking so far."
"One of the times during the internship this semester that I had to act as a conduit to aid in aligning objectives was during the creation of the intake questionnaires for the grant. With this grant in the planning stage of development, for many weeks the group was consistently aiming each week to progress in discussion about what metrics should be obtained on the forms, in what manner should they be gathered along with when should certain questions be asked. With every member part of the discussions coming from varying backgrounds, often times discussions would get sidetracked for the entirety of the meeting. After two meetings becoming sidetracked in this manner, I realized in the interest of progressing forward, it was imperative that I gained control of the conversation to guide it in the manner needed to start making conclusions. Through controlling the meeting both through the agenda and the length of topical discussions, in one meeting, the group was able to come to decisive choices on the intake forms."
One of the times when I was left in charge of overseeing a setup for a big company my peers asked me what to do and I help lead them in the right direction for an optimal experience for the customer.
"One part of my internship was completing a resources list for our health coaches to use to assist our participants with resource navigation within the community. Part of the development of this list was to meet with various members of our team to discuss ideas as to what should be included and what the overall end goal was. As leader of this project, I was tasked with the facilitation of the discussions surrounding this project. At times it was difficult to come to any conclusions surrounding this topic because of all of the various ideas that were being discussed. However, through careful navigation of the conversation, I was able to help the group reach a consensus about what we wanted this project to look like."
"One person in my work place is very careful in doing things. At first she was assigned to make models for our projects. Later on, my supervisor found her more good at documenting and marketing so he decided to assign her different work that she was more good at."
"one person who was also having the internship knew Spanish. After the manager knew her strength, she was assigned to help with the customer service team to answer phone calls and help the company do some Spanish translation."
One situation I specifically remember encouraging discussion with others was when I needed others to express their opinions and suggestions for a template I was working on. I wanted it to look professional and appealing so group discussion helped me accomplish this task.
"One time in the immersive space I collaborated with [name] and the student athlete interns he works with, and they used a public speaking application to help foster better speaking habits and to work on their delivery. While demonstrating the technology, [name] was very helpful and guided his students through the process very smoothly, while fostering confidence in each of them. He allowed each student to go through the application twice, and between each time helped to show them how to improve, while critiquing them in an uplifting an encouraging way, which allowed all of them to perform better the second time through. This leadership, of guided helping, and inspiring confidence while teaching, was a great display that I was able to take from, and will hopefully employ some of those same tactics in the future."
"One time in the warehouse, the warehouse manager brought everyone together and spoke to them about a huge Lowe's order that had to be sent out that day. It was a very motivated teaching speech."
One time that fits this question might have been when I helped organize interns to work together in restarting specific settings on machines in the watt building. They were to report their results to our mentor and after they did their work I went back in the next day to check on all of the results.
"One time that I encouraged people to discuss their different points of view was when I worked on the several small projects throughout the year. During this time I worked with several other people in the department to decide about pictures that would be posted or media projects that we would be collaborating on. Throughout these projects, I encouraged the other members to discuss any problems that they had with my decisions and told them that I was willing to change any decisions if the group felt it was best. The teams were often very appreciative of my willingness to work with them and contributed more than they would have if I had not respected their thoughts."
"One time when I worked with a research project w/ people from other domain. Because of that, each person has their own point of view based on their domain. As a result, we used to have some meaningless discussion as everybody wants to sell their points. I realized one way to resolve this issue is to decouple the project into different level, from high level to low level, from one domain module to another. We first need to get agreement on high level direction questions, it might be general but answers the question where we go. Then for the detailed implementation, as we cut into different modules -- each module will encourage people in this domain to take a lead of the discussion, other people will review it. Through this way, we make meaningful progress and make sure we all on the right track."
One wellness activity I taught was SMART goals. I explained what they were and we brainstormed what our personal SMART goals were and shared our vision with each other to keep each other accountable. They all had similar goals and we discussed how we could help each other meet them.
Organized and led CI students to accomplish Clemson Aquaponics objectives
Organizing student help during National Scholars Weekend. I had to make sure current Scholars were available and willing to assist with logistical aspects of the weekend.
"Our boss does a good job of trying to rally everyone to keep people encouraged in increasing bookings, social media presence, and service."
Our event took place right after the big hurricane hit in the month of October and I encouraged discussion about if the event should be postponed or if other means of communication was necessary in order to get all information necessary for the event to take place.
Our HERDS director took charge of the projects and sent us in the right direction.
"Our lab is very collaborative, with members from a diverse set of fields. Because of that, we are often given tasks best suited to our skills. For me, this was normally programming, circuits, and micro-controllers. Utilizing our best skills, we were able to build the best prototype we could as quickly as we could."
"Our largest event for the year is the Donor Appreciation Event. I helped in coordinating and setting up the event. But, I also had to act as a leader by giving people jobs to accomplish so that the event could run smoothly."
"Our managers for each engagement were great examples of leadership. Whenever we were at a site they were constantly checking up to see where each employee was at with their tasks, and often offered to help or give guidance in order to stay on track with the deadline. I learned that a good leader not only need to supervise and or direct to achieve the goal, but also be ready and willing to step in and help if their assistance is needed. Being hands on in a supportive way is a great quality of leadership."
Our Marketing Director had weekly meetings with us as a team to make sure that all of us are on top of our assignments and consistently asks for feedback about what else she can do to help us and what else Tigers Squared can improve on as a whole.
Our mentor always values hearing new and different ideas. He encourages people to share their views and is flexible enough to change the approach. He trusts individuals strengths and help them to grow their skills and talents.
Our mentor appreciated and respected that I was a nutrition major and the other intern was a psychology major. This was helpful in counseling for phone calls. She always found ways to relate to both of our career interests.
"Our mentor had given us a series of tasks to complete, and after initial communication, we went off to complete these tasks. As a team we were able to solve many of the questions we had, and when we were finished, we were able to hear from our mentor what else was needed."
"Our mentor throughout this internship was a masters student. I and my fellow intern co-worker were guided by this student with more experience than us. He helped us bring our ideas together to form one coherent project with dual aspects. He helped better collaborate with each other and helped us better understand what we needed to do to complete a research study. There was one instance where we needed to analyze samples on a machine that neither I not the other intern had ever ran. Our mentor helped set us up with an expert in the lab that taught us all how to run the machine. Then our mentor proceeded to help us with analyzing the samples on the machine, so that we could complete our project."
"Our mentor, [mentor], assigns projects based on the needs of the building and our own capabilities, giving seniors more complicated projects like using an AI to track the number of people in a room, to giving me the task of using monitoring software to create a power schedule for the building."
Our office has weekly meeting to review the week's achievements and set goals for the following week. During these meeting my mentor allows myself and the other intern to present and discuss our ideas for ways to promote the office and gain more clients.
"Our storage unit (cage) was full with different products. It was my responsibility to take care of the cage and report to the supervisor (Director of Engineer) if its not in good shape. After a few months I observed that the cage was full, and I didn't have space to put anymore products. I brought this to my Supervisor's attention. He alerted all the project engineers to mark every product that's no longer need as 'trash' in the cage. He setup an hour long meeting with everyone (7 Project engineers and myself). We were able to clean the cage and organize everything under his supervision."
Our supervisor [name] is always super encouraging to everyone around us. He does an incredible job recognizing people's strengths and encouraging them to pursue what he knows they are good at. He also encourages everyone to learn new skills as well even it doesn't always turn out as planned. Each person on the team brings something different to the table and he knows how to have us work in the best way possible and also learn at the same time.
Our supervisor used monthly safety meetings to create awareness regarding our organization's backing policy. People didn't take backing were seriously. Our supervisor would demonstrate the importance of no backing by giving examples of industrial backing accidents. This helped everyone understand the gravity of the policy and work together to minimize the backing in everyday work.
"Our team is very well-organized. Each person has their own focus, but we all use the same standard and guidelines to make design. For example, we have a design style guide website called ""Kit"" where listed all visual components our team members may refer to when we work on our individual projects. This makes sure our design is consistent across different projects. Also we have lunch and learn session every month, so that we could learn some skills together."
"Out at HERDS, one of the interns was the director while the rest of us were assistant directors. During one of our Sunday meetings, the director sat down with us and had a new task that needed to be completed. This task involved coming up with a list of certifications that students in our creative inquiry could get trained in. Our director assigned us the different certifications topics in a strategic manner based on our major. For example, one of the interns was a mechanical engineering major so they got the topic pertaining to machinery. I got a construction topic because my major pertains to this. Our director was using our strengths to get the job done."
"Out of all the 4 interns in my department, my supervisor delegated different tasks to each of us based on our experience and interests so that the work could be completed effectively and consistently throughout the semester."
"Over spring break, I was able to sit and interview two Haitian fish farmers regarding what I and the rest of the organization may be able to do to help expand production in the Central Plateau of Haiti. This helped remind just how important CEDC's mission is to improve the quality of life of people in the Central Platuea."
"Part of being an intern at the makerspace includes searching for issues to problems within the space and determining ways to resolve or improve conditions. An example of this was when I recognised that spools on the 3d printers were often becoming entangled about themselves, causing prints to fail. Thus I lead the research and development of new spool holders that were optimised to prevent the entanglement and be easily inserted into the current shelf frame system."
"Part of my job involves helping the graduate students in my department. While helping one graduate student harvest, I constantly asked questions about the process and why we were doing each process. As we worked, I realized that it might help to make some changes and when I suggested them, he agreed that they would increase the speed and efficiency in which we harvested."
"Part of my role is to signal to drivers how many guests in ECVs they have going to the park. This is to aid the drivers during the loading process, because the ECVs are loaded before standing guests and the drivers need to be prepared to do so. Midway through my program, greeters would try to signal to drivers that they had no ECVs to load by shaking their heads, or signaling zero, and drivers would misunderstand that signal as them having no guests so they would drive right by the load zone, without loading the standing guests. I got many of my coworkers together to discuss the problem we were having and then approached our leaders. While our leaders were unable to give us a clear answer, we were then able to approach various drivers with the problem to find a solution that worked best for us and them, and then immediately make that change in our load zones. Now, we wait for drivers to ask if the ECV is going with them and we are then able to signal by shaking our heads. Now we have less driver/greeter miscommunication and fewer guests left behind."
Participated in discussions regarding the marketing strategies that the Bulls Sox Academy could use.
"PEER/Wise is dedicated to retaining and providing resources for minorities and women who are in the STEM field at Clemson Unviersity. My supervisors oversees a group of PEER mentors in which they do everything in their power to help them achieve their goals and to also retain them at Clemson, all while promoting events and group opportunities to surround themselves around others trying to achieve their ultimate goal in becoming engineers."
"Per the request of one of our board members, I was given the task to investigate and ultimately create a member directory. The need to continue our goal of being a tight knit community of learners despite our ever expanding membership base became an area of evaluation. We determined that an online member directory was a great way for our members to stay connected. Based on this part of our mission statement, I developed a report for our board of advisors that explained how a member directory would benefit OLLI, improve the effectiveness of our mission statement, and provided solutions to creating a member directory with all the features we desired."
Personal leadership -Capitalizing on my skills like being independent and time management
"[Name] and [name] were other interns, but they took the lead on the intern project and lead everyone. They facilitated outside meetings and tasks. They split up the work to different departments and encouraged us to work together. They made sure to keep everyone on track and engaged."
Plate making is an important step in the pre-press process. Each individual on our team has different methods to succeed in plate making. As I continue to perfect my process of making plates I have gleaned numerous tips from each team member to ensure that I can be proficient and dependable when assigned this task. I actually enjoy making plates with knowledge that each one has a high value of cost to our company.
Please see my answer for question 24.

"Prior to the Spring Jubilee Festival, we realized that the construction in downtown Pendleton would cause a change in our usual booth locations. Many returning artists were frustrated with this change, but I was able to converse with some and change their perspective into a positive one. The construction would result in a very beneficial change for Pendleton and help us in the future."
Provided feedback to Committee Members from a student perspective
"Throughout my internship, there were multiple opportunities for group discussion during meetings with the GIS team or just working in collaboration with my fellow interns. I think one important characteristic for someone who believes that have qualities of being a leader, is encouraging others around you to criticize you or your work. Frequently my mentor would criticize my work or ideas in a constructive way of course, but just as frequently, I would encourage my fellow intern to take a look at my program or map and constructively criticize them in the most honest way possible. The discussions we had over our work very frequently led us to positive results, which was especially crucial when we were working towards the same goal on a joint project."
"Recently, project management has rolled out a new strategy that includes having teams document their projects in a more rigorous way. Teams that have been around for a longer time were not incredibly receptive, so it took constant encouragement to convince them that these methods would lead them to their immediate goals more quickly, and that ultimately the goal of their project, to create a low cost water testing unit that remotely communicates data, has global implications."
[Name] conducted a teach meeting every week where we discussed the weeks goals and plan to covering events.
"Scrum is a project management methodology used in Software Engineering. We have a bi-weekly Scrum meeting wherein each team-member shares openly what projects that have worked on in the preceding two weeks, where they are at with their projects, and what issues are ""blocking"" their progress. These meetings are conducted by my UPIC Mentor, [mentor]."

"Similarly to collaboration, I took leadership in helping prepare some of the activities for WOW Jr. The other volunteers and I came together to complete the shared goal of a finished activity."
"Since all of my mentees were Computer Science students, I held a meeting where they all were to sit and discuss with each other, what they expected from each other, and how they can help each other succeed this semester. I also asked them how I could be an aid in this. Because of this encouragement, my mentees were really close, and communicated with each other to help each other with their classes."
"Since I am graduating, I knew it was crucial to prepare my team to take over this project for next year. I started by making sure each of them had the same level of responsibility as I did and that we all had equal communication with our client. I constantly reassured the members that their youth didn't mean they weren't valuable members of the team and that their input was welcome."
"Since I am the only one working on my project (besides my mentor, who is assisting me), my capabilities (and limitations) are what ultimately influence the future direction of the project."
Since I have been here the longest interns were always coming to me for questions or advice
"Since I have worked on this farm a long time and have had the experience already I feel I have expert leadership skills. This skills defiantly came in handy when I had to train the new summer workers on how things are done on the farm, how to complete a certain task and how to work the equipment on the farm."
"Since I was an intern and there were employee who were doing somewhat same things that I used to do (analyze packaging), one of my mentor asked me to share my work with them and take their views on same. This is the time where I felt that instead of sharing(email) I should meet with them and communicate face to face as this will allow me to make them understand my work better which eventually will help us in achieving same goal in better way."
"Since I was an intern in my company, I never got to lead a team in a high professional level. But, during the annual picnic of the company, I was leading the volleyball team which was formed by my work team members. I was considering the fact that everyone should play and always stay positive and learn from the mistakes everyone including myself was making during the game. There were situations where we were behind the match and everyone had different point of view for catching the score. I always encouraged the team to get together in time-outs to quickly share points and conclude a mutual strategy. We ended up to the final of the matches which was pretty satisfying."
"Since I was just an intern, I don't really have a big stage to show my leadership. I tried my best to connect with each other and show my leadership. For example, when my colleagues sometimes cannot finish his works since he had too many to deal with. I helped him to finish that part of the works."
Since I was one of the returning interns at the office I was given more responsibilities than I have in the past. I was also asked to plan more events such as meetings for all the interns. Being one of the senior interns some of the newer interns looked to me when they had questions.
"Since I worked independently with only my site mentor I had very few opportunities to empower others in the workspace. However, I had to take the led on all of my projects which I believe makes up for the lack of human interaction."
"Since I'm working solo on this project there are not a lot of opportunities for me to work and interact with others. Therefore, leadership has not necessarily been a main focus throughout this semester."
"Since my team is very small with my mentor, manager and myself I haven't had a real opportunity to work with a group etc."
"Since my work my not a typical group project, I did not have the chance to lead the team. However, I took the lead in planning deadlines for myself to make sure work was completed in time. This quality I learnt by observing my mentor"
"Since the stated goal of the Watt Center was to provide a collaborative space for people to work on projects. To this end, I took the time to both contact groups that could use the technology in the building and inform other students about features of the building."
"Since we have different sections of our department, I took the place as the spokesperson during our weekly meetings. I took all of the information that I was given from the other student employees and managers, and I was able to make sure that their concerns and questions were presented in the meeting."
Sitting in on drop-in counseling appointments with several different counselors allowed me to observe how they connect and encourage students of different skills and backgrounds.

"So when we are working and someone reports a problem, all the interns would go up to the room and collobartive help solve the problem. We would take into account what each of our strengths and weaknesses and decide who should do what."
Social media calendar and all the help that came with it
"Some defective parts were sent back to the plant from the customer. My supervisor put together a team to analyze the parts, to determine the reason for failure in the parts. The team worked over time and for a few days with various people taking turns to help with the task at hand to get to the cause of the problem and ensure that no defective parts are sent out."
"Steven always made sure to assign us tasks he thought we had the necessary skills to complete. Also, when choosing teams for the group projects, he took into account everyones strengths and weaknesses and how we could help each other."
Successfully led the Time study project of the BMW G01 line and also the torque and Pullout study for AVK Fasteners
supervise students during activities
Supervisor appreciated the work done by people under him by giving them usual praises. For a project I noticed he gave them a appreciation certificate as well.
Supervisor ask coworkers there opinion on a big program we were working on.
Taking charge in tasks when its necessary for someone to step up.
"Taking in OLLI members opinion on new classes, the employees were always very willing to listen"
Taking the lead on my Annual Report project and dishing out even portions of work to the other students assisting.
Taking up responsibilites for quality issues
Talking to different groups on how they can help the fundraising and talking to other directors on how to proceed.
"Tbh, I would not say that I'm a leader in this role. I am simply an average employee."
"Team meetings every Tuesday and Thursday. It was during these discussions we made sure everyone spoke up about the problems they faced in the project, and everyone was encouraged to speak up on any potential solution ideas to resolve it."
Thanks to my experience over the summer I have basic knowledge of the Watt Center's operations. I used this knowledge to help new interns learn some of the day-to-day tasks that are performed. Because I had recently been in the same situation I was able to answer questions they had and tell them important things I learned.
"The ""It's Not Too Late Campaign"" is a great example of my effective leadership efforts. The shared vision was to promote studying abroad this summer by passing out snack with slogans to the student body. I was able to get the whole office behind me on this mission and get them involved to the point where they felt invested in the process as well. At our meeting, everyone was really excited about the project and wanted to voice their opinions and ideas as well. I was able to effectively get them to participate and empowered them through my updates on our successes along the way. Every time I would finish passing out the snacks, I would come back to the office with a new story about how much they meant to the students and the group really enjoyed hearing how their part of the projects transcended into this positive end result."
The assistant manager of the farm was very passionate about teaching me and the others about proper equipment care and use as well as animal care and health.
The best example of this is when we were having a somewhat slow day and so I challenged one of my colleagues to break his usual record sales for the week.
"The best exast example I have of this is creating the survey for the alumni banquet and newsletter and allowing students to select answers I hoped were holistic to the range of responses they could give. I also included a question that allowed students to suggest ideas to us about what they wanted not only for the alumni banquet but for the department as a whole. This semester I didn't have very many group meetings, most were one-on-one or me acting as a liaison between two different parties.mple I have of this is creating the survey for the alumni banquet and newsletter and allowing students to select answers I hoped were holistic to the range of responses they could give. I also included a question that allowed students to suggest ideas to us about what they wanted not only for the alumni banquet but for the department as a whole. We have been trying to use this information to provide better services to the students. This information is going into the website I was beginning this semester and planned to develop more next semester. This semester I didn't have very many group meetings, most were one-on-one or me acting as a liaison between two different parties."
The Board of Directors meets often to discuss how we can work together to increase our impact and one of these ways is by communicating how we can reach more people
The Call My Name project was a very difficult project to get rolling at the beginning of the semester because they scope of what [mentor] was hoping to accomplish was so wide. We had to work to narrow that scope and find specific direction and targetable goals to achieve by the end of the semester and build a roadmap for successive semesters. One such instance was setting up a meeting with [name] over in Athletics to gain his insight on video and digital media so we could communicate [mentor]s' message through those mediums. There were a lot of moving parts for me to align in setting up the meeting and we left the structure of the meeting open to encourage brainstorming and idea generation and thinking within a very specific mindset.
The CI Decipher group did a great job cataloging the strengths and characteristics of CI members and writing about their areas of research.
"The conference center staff is pretty diverse, as far as personalities and strengths go. One of my supervisors always knows which employees to ask about which tasks because he knows what they're good at and what they're not good at and don't enjoy doing."
The cool part about my position is that I get to work with a lot of international students. This presents a lot of cool challenges because people communicate in different ways and you want to be able to present things to the postdocs in ways that they will fully understand. My boss has done an excellent job of exemplifying to me the best way to communicate with people that come from different backgrounds. She leads the postdoc community well and they all appreciate her greatly. She has done a good job as leader of showing her that she truly does care for their best interest.
"The department put on the Recyclemania competition at Clemson this year and also organized the Zero Waste Game in coordination with Recyclemania and I played a large role in organizing the events that went along with it. We had to meet with athletic leaders to figure out exactly what we would be allowed to do and when. It was very complicated to try to align two different organizations (Clemson Basketball and Recycling) who had two very different goals, but we managed to work together and produce a successful result."
"The director of my department does a great job of meeting with other department heads to get a clear understanding of what they want/expect when requesting a project from marketing, then presents us with a broad idea of how she thinks we should go about it, but then opens up the floor for anyone to chime in with any differing ideas they may have on their area of expertise"
"The director of the department that I work made it a point, both at the beginning of and throughout the semester, to meet with every mentor and ask them what they would like for the organization to look like. She didn't just do this for pretense, she actively listened and put in the work to help start on that path and eventually reach that goal. She was allowing us to have a hand in how the organization was shaped."
"The employee recognition and reward program within Development is very developed and has been one of my favorite projects to work on throughout the duration of my time at the Development office. My mentor serves as the Director of Talent Management and Operations which includes our reward/incentive program that involves monthly recognition based on goal accomplishments and allows for a very supportive environment. She is also great at recognizing the strengths of others and respecting their interests, and she does a great job in assigning tasks that match both skill set and interest without limiting opportunities among four part-time interns at a time."
The entire business was just me so I had to take the initiative for everything and motivate myself and lead myself.
"The entire structure of the study abroad office relies on specific supervisors assigning and entrusting tasks for their individual interns to complete. One unique example of this was between [mentor] and [name] this semester. Although [name] was hired to be a general intern with very specific tasks initially, [mentor] soon discovered that [name] was very gifted in graphic design and marketing. She decided to utilize this skill set and put him in charge of our ""its not too late"" ad campaign. In a matter of days we were able to get this message, in addition to a well-made video from [name], out to thousands of students. Our numbers consequently spiked. This was a great example of a supervisor recognizing and utilizing the specific strengths of an individual."
"The ERM department is very small, consisting of only myself, my boss, and my other fellow intern [name]. Thus, our boss entrusted [name] and I with a lot of responsibility and gave us the freedom to take our tasks in any direction in which we felt best. By not requiring a specific way of doing something, this required me to take initiative in my tasks and take the leadership to contact the appropriate people to explore all options to better our process."
"The first thing I did when I was tasked with finding a way to monitor power in the Watt center is ask my fellow interns how they would go about solving this problem. I was given many different ideas, from placing a monitor onto the ground wire of the power strip, to using a modified raspberry pi computer, to using server-class power monitors. In the end I had settled on a plug-load monitor which was more expensive than we had preferred but would reliably accomplish this goal."
"The hackathon was not a project that my mentor assigned to me, but rather, a project that I came up with, developed into an idea, came together with a team of fellow students to define and bring about. In recognizing Clemson's organizational goals of enhancing student learning through REAL engagement and learning, I was able to align those goals with my team's goals of recruiting new talent and supporting the hacker culture at Clemson. By recognizing this opportunity and clearly communicating its value, I was able to convince my mentor that this was a valuable use of my time as a UPIC. The hackathon itself required the aligning of multiple groups' interestsCUhackit, the Watt Center, the Clemson Makerspace, the Immersive Space, Student Affairs, Student Government and multiple corporate and Clemson sponsor such as Siemens and Clemson Mobile. Beyond raising $35k for the event, we were able to secure the entire Watt Center for the weekend for free and received hundreds of dollars worth of in-kind donations in the form of materials for the event. None of this would have been possible if multiple groups had not been aligned in their objectives and goals."
"The infusion preparation process was done in a manner that ended up in a gig in the transom and eventually needed a team member to go to next station and fix that gig. I dug into the root cause and trained the people working on that section to prevent the occurrence in the first place, thus achieving the common vision of Lean Manufacturing"
"The input of Power BI by me made the data analyzing and visualizing really easy and neat, and it encouraged the entire quality team to learn about it. and it also encouraged everyone to take the trial version to learn Power BI."
"The internship at the dairy is not really a group activity, its generally only two individuals running the parlor: one intern, one farm employee. That being said, the two full time guys who run the parlor have to work with all of the interns, needing to vary their timing and approach accordingly for each."
The internship supervisor would always be aware of an interns capability. A lot of us come from different backgrounds and majors and have different levels of experience and skill and he knows how to designate a job for all of us.
"The machine shop manager is the highest form of leadership in the machine shop. I am constantly interfacing with [name] to work out new ways to improve the machine shop. I then relay these policies and ideas to the rest of the team and collaborate to execute these items to improve the operation of the shop. Our goal is to operate like a top 20 machine shop in the USA, and we are constantly striving for that goal."
"The main example I have for this section deals with the vast amount of time and effort that went into editing, revising, and updating policies that were meant to help the staff remain efficient, safe, and adherent to the Joint Commission standards."
The majority of the time i was alone when classes came and visited so i had to lead a big group of people.
"The non-profit I interned for is a coalition that is made up of a bunch of different health organizations in the county. The coalition meets once or twice a month to talk about what their different projects are and how the other organizations in the coalition can support, help, or work together to make the projects better. [Mentor], my manager, is the executive director of Healthy Rowan so I sat in a lot of meetings where she could take two different organizations and their resources and help them work together to achieve a goal or provide a service for a population in need."
The office was planning ways to recruit students for studying abroad in the summer and fall and I took part in meetings where new ideas were encouraged and thoughtfully considered. I responded as positively and thoughtfully as I could to others suggestions.
The online employee evaluation system was an idea that my mentor wanted to implement. He gathered a group of us to collaborate and work towards achieving the idea he had in mind. He took leadership and guided us towards implementing the new system.
The other intern and I constantly discuss work and projects. Our work is very design based so we are always asking for feedback and possible changes.
The other interns and I would communicate with problems we encountered and would pool our knowledge before asking others around us and at higher levels.
"The partners encouraged us to always remember why we do what we do, even when the work is tedious, burdensome, and mind-numbing: our clients trust us to prepare their returns accurately, legally, and in a way that maximizes their tax savings."
"The PEER/WISE Office regularly puts on Wednesday night leadership development series. I attended one about studying abroad. The information was given to all of the mentees to come and some of them did. I was then able to add to that lecture and talk about my own experiences studying abroad. I aligned the objective of getting the ""study abroad experience"" out to the freshmen engineers by giving my personal experience along with the broader organization of the Study Abroad Office's presentation."
The plant manger at my plant leads a team of supervisor from all departments. He conducts morning meetings to assess the performance and he acts a bridge between all departments. He listens to their input and gives a lot of value to the feedback of other team members.
"The President of the Makerspace has been away this Summer at an internship in Seattle, so the responsibility fell onto me to lead the Makerspace in the right direction, as if the President had never left. Things like hiring practices, certain purchases, and creating tools for the next generation of interns to use."
"The Pro Benefits Expo is a complex event regarding multiple space reservations and a large amount of third-party vendors. My client, his boss, and another woman from the department were in charge of planning this event and requested me to assist in this process. At the meeting, I made sure to bring in other pools of knowledge such as the head of operations and my mentor. It was as if his team was just meeting for the first time and things were initially chaotic. I managed to step up to the plate and use my title as SEC to align everyone's visions and keep us focused on the main goal while keeping the group satisfied. The Pro Benefits Expo was a huge success, and the client along with his department has said that they will be working with us on all future events."
The projects that I worked on were completely independent projects so in context I was leading the projects all by myself and this taught many things at every stage of the project delivery.
The Software that we made once failed at the midnight. I took the responsibility of the code that I had written and also analyzed to see that my fellow teammate whose code did not had problem. We both then together solved the issue and we solved it better that we got an appreciation form the higher management on making a very nice validation software application.
The Sr. Quality Manager to whom I reported inspired me by his style of addressing people and issues. He always stayed focus and delegates work accordingly.
"The student employees at Campus Recreation is a diverse group. [Name] and [name] has always recognized students who have worked hard and those who were willing to help by providing REC Points. REC Points are worth/ equal to $5. Once a month, students can use their points to buy Clemson merchandise."
"The university intern project involved working with public relations, writing, photography, and creative interns. AS lead video intern I had to attend all the meetings and communicate what our team could contribute to the project."
"The virtual reality immersive space itself is a part of two different organizations, the virtual reality club, which is student operated, and the CCIT Virtualization Lab, which is operated by university faculty. As a member of the former and an employee of the later, it was my responsibility to work to fulfill the goals of both organizations, whether it be in providing assistance and access to the space's technology, or working to recruit additional members to our space's club through our normal hours of operation."
"The woman above my boss held a conference called the Autism Awareness Workshop where she brought in professionals from many different areas that dealt with Autism like occupational therapists, speech pathologists, psychiatrists, and pediatricians to speak about their work with Autism. She was able to recognize the strengths of people from different work backgrounds and bring them together through a common interest."
"The work I did in promoting study abroad opportunities for STEM majors and the RiSE community helped make it possible for these students to go abroad. Through information and drop-in sessions I helped RiSE students find programs that could work for their majors and advised them on how to go about the study abroad process. Some of them then planned to study abroad in the summer or in future semesters at Clemson. I worked closely with [mentor], my mentor, to make these sessions happen and discussed my accomplishments with these students with her weekly."
There are many instances where my boss and his boss have to come together to figure out how to execute a certain program and discuss which solution would be the most user friendly.
"There had been an everlasting problem of gear measurement frequency at the company I work at. I created a solution to the problem, presented it with the engineers and decided to lead the project."
"There have been many times that I have had to take charge in the shop. For example, during strike (when we clean up a show) it was my responsibility to remain in the shop while my mentor worked on stage. I had to oversee multiple works and direct them in taking apart pieces, cleaning up debris, putting away pieces, and organizing tools and parts. I had to actively discuss with the workers what they"
There is still alot of things that I need to learn about leadership because it is not something that comes naturally. But through collaborating and communicating with my peers I have become more confident in my abilities to lead people.
"There isn't many opportunities to delegate work but as far as showing leadership skills, each intern is required to lead in their respective areas."
"There was a day when the company had to achieve the common goal of meeting with all the scheduled clients, but it was too much for a normal work day. I suggested that we delegate and split up, with me doing the duties that I could perform on my own without the vet's direct guidance. We got everything done in the day with time to spare."
"There was a problem with people taking chairs from the creative lounge and the interns having no place to sit at the table. I was a part of the discussion to suggest several different approaches to solving this problem. In the end, we got a sign that has the studio hours on it and a reserved seating message."
"There was a time during my internship that we faced a time of hardship when we were vandalized and had significant property damage. During this time, tensions ran high and there was a rush to solve the issues we faced and catch the culprit. Everyone had different opinions of how it happened and how to contact the authorities to fix it, but the bottom line showed that the damage had been done and needed to be repaired. This situation showed me that during employment, there were going to be external hardships that influenced the way that day to day operations were run. In order to facilitate helpful discussion and to solve the issues, I listened to everyone's opinions and allowed them to speak their mind, while I turned to day to day operations and repair so they would not worry about the menial issues. While my supervisors were involved in conversation and the following investigation, they did not have to worry about the day to day tasks and were able to solve the crime with my help."
There was another intern who worked on different days than me. I stayed in contact with her to ensure that we were on the same page and being efficient and consistent in our work.
There was another intern working alongside me throughout the duration and often times we were assigned to the same project. If we were not on the same page it was very difficult to complete a task so it was vital that we worked together to achieve a common goal.
There was leadership practice everyday at the studio because of the constant teaching that had to happen. Helping groups with thier project and working through a variety of problems made me use leadership skills constantly.
"There was one day when all of us interns and our mentors went up to 4th floor WATT and we had to trace every electrical wire to it's correct box. This lead us to form a team in which we all had a job that we lead. Someone plugged in and tested the boxes, someone flipped the switches to see which ones worked, and someone wrote down the information."
There was one new employee that started mid summer and he was very good at driving a skid steer. Every day a supervisor put him on one and he was the main guy to work it.
There was one project where the deadline to get the project out was very quick and people needed to work extra hours so that we could finish in time. On the day that the project was due there were about 8 people that had to stay later and work together to finish. I had been working on the project the entire week before and knew a lot about which drawings we needed and which ones that we did not need. I ended up being the person that everyone was asking questions to and I had to give out work to certain people to do so that we could be more efficient. The project ended up going out on time and the client was happy to see that it had been done within the short time frame.
"There was one time where each of us interns were discussing what our current projects were, and what we were doing to achieve them. At this meeting, we were able to provide feedback to the other interns as we saw fit in order to understand if the project's goals were being met along with whether the project was being completed in the most efficient way possible."
There wasn't much room for leadership in the internship as I worked alone. Examples may include my supervisor speaking with new students and answering their concerns differently depending on their specific needs.
"there wasn't really an opportunity to ""lead"" however I was the most senior in the photography position"
"There were many different tasks in the office that required a fool proof procedure. When entering surveys or mailing out individual packages to the different counties, it took thought and insight from everyone involved to create a process that would make my work as efficient as possible. I took it upon my self to collaborate with others around me and make decisions on what would work best for me and others working on the task."
There were two activities where I was in charge of leading a group of volunteers in clean-up events and environmental improvement. The first event was a pond restoration at the Anderson Civic Center and the second event was a stream clean up where I was in charge of 13 kids age 11-17 in an effort to restore a stream off of 28 by-pass in Anderson SC.
"these events have yet to take place, however, they are guaranteed. I am the only intern from my organization that was asked to return for next semester. I noticed that the student in charge of us what having trouble expressing in detail what exactly he wished the other interns would improve on. I offered my help as best i could to share my opinion politely this semester. These efforts were appreciated and I am currently in discussion with the head of the Immersive Space to help train the next group of interns on their expected daily conduct while on the job."
"They are designing a storage rack in here, the quality manger had some concerns with the first concept, so they had to redone it. for the 2nd prototype review, the quality manger did not show up for some reason. We had to make a quick decision. I used my previous knowledge about quality and the concerns they had about these racks to lead the team to do some testing and make suggestions for improvements. I took pictures of what we suggested and showed it to the quality manger later on, and he approved it."
"This happened during a department meeting. My supervisor, gave the opportunity to the engineer to lead a particular project, as a recognition to the hard work he had done to collect all the background information."
This intern did not give me a commanding role as a leader. Decisions were not based on me and hence leading a team was never an option.
"This is a general answer, but every project that was assigned to me was completely given to me. My mentors didn't need to stay on email chains or check in every step of the way because they fully trusted my responsibility and leadership capabilities."
This is displayed weekly as my Mentor leads meetings for the PEER Mentors. In these meetings we discuss how our mentees are doing and learn academic and life strategies to pass along to them.
"This is practiced all of the time in my internship position. My UPIC is largely related to event coordinating and preparing. In order to achieve our goals for each event in a proper manner, my UPIC mentor meets with me and the other UPIC intern and explains everything that needs to happen for each individual event and tells us what we need to do in order for the whole to work together to achieve success."
"This is similar to my answer to question 23. Anytime we would meet with stakeholders our overall goal was to help everyone see directly where on the process they fit in, and how others contributed to the success of the overall process. In this way we not only allowed the stakeholders to own the process themselves but also be aware and acknowledge the contributions of all the members of the process as a whole."
"This job is all about leadership and finding a form of leadership that works best for your team. For me, that form of leadership is ripped right from ""The leadership challenge"" by Kouzues and Posner; Find a common goal. In my world of special events, we all always want the same thing, for the event to be successful and for the client to be happy (and at the end, to hurry up and go to bed). I think the best example I have for this from the semester would be the Paint Party that CLEMSONLiVE puts on every August for the new freshmen. Campus Activities and Events is in charge of running that event, and for providing things such as a crowd barricade and generators for the DJ's equipment. Unfortunately for me, I only had 1 staff member who was crowd control trained, so it was me, him, and my old director of operations setting up a rather heavy barricade. The adversity and leadership came in when it was 1:30 in the morning, and we were still trying to pick up these 200-300 pound, wet and slippery pieces of metal, and load them back into our truck. We all wanted one thing, to be in bed, so in order to make sure we all met that goal before sunrise, I essentially opened the floor to any and all suggestions to get to get the barricade back into the truck. Finally, after many ideas had been tossed around, we found a solution that worked and made it to bed before 3:00."
"This position taught me a lot about what a true manager should look like. I had to be tough on some people, even though I didn't want to. I also learned how to correctly motivate people in order to see them succeed."
"This pretty much happened anytime I assist a photographer on a shoot. As a photographer, especially on campus, you have to work as a team to capture the right photograph. This often times involved taking on leadership roles to achieve the appropriate end goal."
"This question does not apply to my internship, but a time that my supervisor did develop a team was during the hiring process. All the employees met at the beginning of the semester and we all had one common goal, to make the dairy farm more efficient."
"This semester a group of mentors volunteered with Habitat for Humanity. Our project involved laying down sod for a morning. In order to make this more efficient, I encouraged the group to work together and form an assembly line in order to get the work done as quickly as possible. In doing this, a task that usually takes the entire morning (8am to 12pm) ended up only taking 2.5 hours (8am to 1030am)."
"This semester I had the pleasure of training my replacement for this position. During this process, I took the approach to let her learn while doing. I wanted her to be hands on so that she was not overly stressed when I was not there. I would give her an event and run through it with her but then she would finish it from start to finish."
"This semester I have had to become a stronger leader with other student employees. When necessary, I must train Hub staff to prepare daily Money Drops so that we will have proper documentation and strong evidence if there were ever an issue. On occasion I have needed to take corrective action if a Hub Staff member is incorrectly preparing documentation of payments."
This semester I have observed my supervisor utilize different people from unique backgrounds in order to help her evaluate candidates in a hiring process for a position that became vacant in December. She has coordinated schedules of different people across varying departments so that they could all be there to give her their opinions about who the best candidate should be.
This semester I have really had to step up to be a leader as I am the oldest person here and I have been here for the longest. This semester I have had to train new SEC's for them to take over while balancing school and my job well.
This semester I mostly had to work by myself. This is because when developing software it is best to have one developer working on the project.
This semester I was appointed head intern for my event so I was able to work with a number of other interns. This level of responsibility helped me to gain valuable leadership skills and improve upon the skills that I already had. I was responsible for delegating tasks and this including making sure each intern was given a task that best suited their strengths and making sure things were done on time.
This semester my bosses really let me take responsibility is teaching and helping out the newest intern with anything she had questions about. This was a great way for me to step into a leadership role.
"This semester my supervisor asked me to do a talk on the recycling options we have for events, in the hope to move toward a more sustainable presence on campus. During this talk I explained our options on campus, off campus, and pricing options. Being able to contribute in this way is awesome, as sustainability is something I'm very passionate about."
"This semester since I have not been focusing on training our new interns but rather doing research, I have had the opportunity to really watch my manager. She assigns tasks and make suggestions based on what she knows about each of the interns but also challenges them so they have the opportunity to grow and learn something new."
"This semester was a lot of personally led projects. This involved a lot of self leadership, when I was at the Greenbuild conference I had to take the initiative to talk with experts about my project. I had to make them interested in my project in order to talk to me about it."
This semester was unique in that it was the first regular semester with the new police chief. That brought its benefits and challenges. A lot of what we do at student patrol is changing towards meeting broader campus safety objectives. Chief [name] is actively working to expand our role and change our perception on campus by adding new positions and programs. This requires a lot of leadership on my part in order to make sure all of our positions are working together effectively and aware of what the immediate and overarching goals are.
This semester we are training two new SEC's so I have been able to help train them both in our procedures and policies.
This semester we have primary worked as a team to get assignments done but I am my own leader in ensuring I hold up my weight on tasks.
"This semester we launched our ""It's Not Too Late"" initiative and I spear-headed the campaign by bringing the vision to our group and getting input on how to best achieve it. We decided on handing out flyers, extending drop-in hours, and using our networks to get other organizations involved. Everyone was very engaged in the ideas and excited about making it happen. My leadership definitely aided in the effectiveness of this campaign and I am proud of all the success that my coworkers achieved."
This semester we were required to give training sessions. On of my peers was not very happy about this. Another peer and myself gave him the opportunity to express his concerns to us but still encouraged him to give it his best effort.
"This semester, CEDC implemented a new project life cycle that would create deliverables for every stage of the research, design, and implementation processes. My fellow interns and I were tasked with doing back end evaluation of the new guidelines and determined that it detracted from the progress of many groups. From this determination, a new group within the organization will be formed that takes some of the research burden off of many groups."
"This semester, I had the opportunity to lead groups of students in exploring Clemson and various engineering disciplines. Through SEE Clemson I gave prospective students and their parents tours of campus and sat on a panel for the students to ask questions about Clemson. For both Girl Scouts Day and STEM day I was the leader of a group of students and led them around campus and to the various engineering activities that were planned for them."
"This semester, I took complete control over the career center's blog, Crafting Your Clemson Career. I delegated content creation to undergrad career ambassadors and had to communicate the blog's vision and mission to the ambassadors so they understood their responsibility as writers."
"This story is the same as the one that I had for communication. But essentially, we realized that the way that we were doing something caused a lot of problems and concerns that we hadn't realized previously. Because of the issues that came up, I brought it up to our group during a staff meeting and asked for ideas or options or comments about the way we did it currently and how we could fix it. After coming up with ideas, we found a solution that will make the situation go much smoother and is more fair to the students in a way that it wasn't before."
"This was during the 5S audit in the plant. There was a template to be prepared for the audits. Many people gave their opinion regarding what to include and what not. I gave my support to one idea which I felt to be impressive and my inputs were considered. in the end, my inputs were used as a feedback and changes were made accordingly."
This year for Give Day I decided to help explain to some of my friends why they should considering giving to Clemson and hopefully continue giving to Clemson for years to come no matter the amount!
"Thought my entire internship [name] and I had to communicate efficiently because we were working side by side on the same project but weren't necessarily in the office at the exact same time. I created google docs to combine our research and interviewing materials and any other materials we gathered throughout the process. We also work on collaboration during phone calls with [name], both participating and ""interviewing"" [name]. Also I was given the opportunity to be the leader and present our work from the entire semester to the Board of Directors for the Spiro Institute."
"Through facilitation of collaborative work on project proposals for the lunchbox gardens, nutrition and culture sheets for sweet potatoes we grew, and development of branding and signage."
Through my internship I show great leadership skills. I am the oldest internship in the office in terms of experience so I am able to help out other interns with any questions. I also have showed leadership through trying to complete my hours with a severe injury. I feel all the interns at the office create and accomplish a shared vision because we all have different projects we work on and communicate with each other on those projects so we can help out the office as a whole.
"Through my internship, I got to see my mentor develop his presentation to present to his colleagues to convince them that service learning is an effective way to teach."
"Through this experience, I was able to serve as a leader to these students by connecting them to other organizations which I felt that would get them the best connected to Clemson. A couple of these orgs included CUSG, A bevy, and fike."
Through this internship I think that I have gained a lot of confidence when giving others advice about what it takes to run a business at this age. I have given presentations to other college students through [name]'s courses where I have gotten lots of feedback about how inspirational it is.
"Throughout my internship experience, I had met so many individuals on campus. It is one of my favorite parts of the job! I love finding ways to connect with these individuals in the future. It might be a simple hello on campus for some but I am excited to say that I have met with a few of these interviewees for outside volunteer trips."
"Throughout my internship, I have worked to discuss projects to make sure that I am prepared to help film to the best of my ability. This involves discussing the idea and feel behind our projects and what will best visually represent that."
"Throughout my internship, I strived to make connections with each in the office and get an understanding for what they were working on. I found it necessary for each of us to be able to provide help or advice in the instances that another needed it. When someone was struggling with a solution, I would aim to gather opinions, and therefore a solution."
"Throughout my internship, I was responsible for engaging the rest of the Directors of CEDC. This included coordinating efforts between the Current Operations, Internal Communications, and Marketing Directors in order to insure the success of various events. Each of these groups works towards unique goals, but ultimately each group is working in a way that will ultimately allow CEDC to function and communicate more fluidly. My role as Program Director required facilitating communication between these three groups to make sure that although Current Operations is responsible for logistics of trips and events; internal communications is responsible for organizing correspondence between directors and groups and between the organization as a whole; Marketing is responsible for communicating CEDC to community, that all three of these groups realize that ultimately they are working together to allow CEDC to work most efficiently."
"Throughout my internship, individuals would come to me with their information and deadlines and I would create marketing activities based on these specific needs. While the departments are different, they have one thing in common: representing campus recreation in a positive, uplifting light. This broad organizational objective was necessary in creating consistent, accurate Campus Recreation branding."
"Throughout my Value Propositioning project, I was able to lead department heads in conversations and discussions about the value that comes from each department's roles, which in the end contributed to the common goal of growth in OOBE. These different points of view all contributed to the development of the OOBE Goal."
Throughout the semester we got to meet with different entrepreneur alumni that [name] brought in. This was very interesting and was something that helped me understand what success really was in the business world through many different lenses and industries.
"Throughout the semester work was being done to the 4th floor. Me and another teammate, one day, had to help make sure the electrical connections were properly labeled. This required communicating and being attentive to detail."
"Throughout the semester, all of the interns and mentors would meet as a group. At this time, we would catch everyone up on our individual progress, and our mentors would inform us on how we were progressing with our overall goal. We would also discuss possible marketing ideas for how to get more students to go abroad to further reach our goal. Everyone would contribute ideas that they had, and we would discuss how we would make that idea work. At the end of the meeting we would have reached a decision on how we should promote studying abroad. Some of our previous ideas included a percent night at Groucho's and hanging and handing out flyers for our ""It's Not Too Late"" Campaign."
"Throughout the semester, I have been able to observe my supervisor. One major time that stands out to me regard this question is Beta Gamma Sigma. My advisor, myself, the other intern for my advisor, and few other people involved in the College of Business organized and set up everything prior to the event. My supervisor, [mentor], did a terrific job of explaining her visions for the event and leading us to ensure that the event ran smoothly."
"throughout the various timber cruises, we have worked on, when presented with a problem from other interns I would ask them how they would solve it with the information they have learned in class."
"Throughout this internship at Healthy Campus, I constantly maintained positive relationships with all members of staff. I showed respect to everyone in my office and the students that we interacted with on campus. I appreciated that we were all from different backgrounds and I felt that my acceptance of that really helped facilitate dialogue in various meetings such as the TATT board meetings and the Student Veteran's Commission meetings."
"Throughout this semester I have been working with the IAC to coordinate energy audits and get companies on our page with saving money, and energy."
"Throughout working on different projects, I liked to ask people to test what I had worked on to see if it was comprehendible"
"To help me further understand why we were performing a test and what the data represents, my supervisor had the grad students who were studying in that area explain to me the reasoning. Which helped out a lot."
Today I got one of my co-workers to agree to participate in a fundraising idea that I created.
"Toward the end of this semester we delivered a mobile aquaponics system to Erskin College in Due West, SC. This system was to be used by the college, and to also educate the middle school robotics team as they research ways of developing an automated aquaponics system. With that said, after we installed the system I was fortunate to be able to visit project leaders at Erskin. We had a great conversation about aquaponics and its place in the South Carolina Agriculture. Everyone was open to sharing their ideas and view points and once again they were asking me questions, which I guess would place me in some sort of leadership position."
"Towards the end of my internship, our office was getting new carpet. The days leading up to this were very hectic; people were trying to do their work, but we also had to get everything moved out. The key to this was that everything had to be labeled and organized so that we could move in immediately after to resume operations, as we had guests coming to stay with us that weekend. Because the other members of my team had time sensitive work, I took it upon myself to help them organize files, belongings, and any other work I could aid them with. This helped free them up so that they could aid our customers and we could continue to have impeccable customer service. I am very detailed and thorough, so I was able to help organize who's stuff went where. After our carpet was installed, we were able to resume operations smoothly, and everyone's belongings were accounted for."
[Mentor] my supervisor got three of us to do testing on peaches and he should us all how to do a part to make it efficient as possible and we were able to do it really fast.
[Mentor] told me to do some peach splitting with these girls and so I guess he lead us to a goal.
[Name] and others initiated a sip and paint for our program so that the other students can have a decompressing event.
"[Mentor] has been an interesting supervisor to work with, as he does a lot with Creative Inquiry. It was interesting to see the way that he manages his team of Decipher writers and handles their needs as well as mine. (Decipher and I share an office space.)"
Two big events were held in the company and my supervisor and I developed a plan to share our goal and tried to achieve it
"Two coworkers were arguing over how to lay sod, and I told them to both share how we should do it and then I tried to make a compromise from those two opinions to make everyone happy"
"Under my first supervisor, [mentor], the division of labor was highly tailored to everyone's strengths and weaknesses. At the beginning of Senate meetings, there are a lot of moving parts to make sure everything goes smoothly. Attendance must be taken from behind (no view of Senator's nametags), guest must be identified and prepared for announcements at the beginning of the session, refreshments must be set-up, name cards distributed. [Mentor] was brilliant at parsing these tasks to the person who excelled at each part."
Understood basic ideas about what all engineers do and then started attending meeting with all of them and learning/analyzing what is going on.
"Upon conclusion of our annual microscopy competition, we had a discussion of what we did and did not like. As the summer intern, I was responsible for getting all of the information together to launch the competition. Likewise, during the fall, our entire group worked as a team to effectively carry out this competition. I developed a document and a post event survey for our mentor so that we could go over what worked and what could be improved on for the next year."
"Upon midterm presentations, all of the interns talk together and provide feedback/ask questions to figure out what everyone else is working on. This is a great way to have informative discussions and really just be able to learn and push everyone else. After one of the interns presentations, myself and another intern were able to ask [name] about his business process so that we would be able to help in to improve."
"Upon the completion of trial, [name] led 3 lab assistants  including myself  towards completing the ultrasonic process of aniloxes for the upcoming trial. His leadership coupled with our group's hard work led to completion of the task in a timely and effective manner."
Using slack to collaborate on projects and tickets
"Very early in our office, I notice our graphic design intern, who had worked for Tigers Squared previously, take initiative in helping people acsess different accounts and help them get familiar with things around the office."
"Very similar to what I described above in the first meeting I had with a Risk Area, we met with that same Risk Area, but this time, the major of the Risk Owners were present at the meeting. We wanted to get their feedback on the dashboards because they would, ultimately, be the ones using the tool we have created. Also, every one of them had a different perspective on the dashboards. For example, one would really enjoy the scatter plots, while another enjoyed a simple bar graph. It allowed us to take into consideration all of their opinions and produce the best dashboard we could for them."
"Was able to provide useful input on the development of the research year in review document, and also was able to make good progress on potential publication"
"We adopted a new project management tool this semester, BaseCamp, I served as the initial tester of the tool and encouraged other interns to fully embrace it to report on projects. This ultimately helped our boss have a better understanding of our accomplishments."
"we all want to be the most efficient, especially with the animals. We all work towards a common goal, and that making sure all animals are meeting daily needs, well and producing efficiently."
We always like to see different sides of each problem. There were many times where I brought in my own prospective to a risk or a way something could be handled.
We analyzed the results from different people and did a open discussion on these results. And we successfully figured out the right way to solve the issues in our fabrication processes.
We are assigned tasks in audits based on what we are good at and occasionally push us into when we could do more
We consistently held meetings with all the interns in University Relations to ensure that all viewpoints were shared in an open forum. My co-lead and I would present ideas and but also empower all the other interns to share their thoughts and give honest feedback to the group as a whole and us as leaders.
"We did a very large project involving about a week and a half of work. One of the things I had envisioned for the project was complete organization. After kind of explaining the method to the group and the benefit, everyone saw the need for us to be methodical in the way we completed the project."
We do a lot of work for and with the social media interns. They present us with topics and events that they would like to advertise and then together we come up with the ideas. When we were introduced to the idea of doing some kind of founder's day video I encouraged us all to work together to develop some kind of unique idea. Something other than a recap video and something interactive.
We encourage others to take on new projects on campus and hopefully off-campus in the near future and just being all hands on deck for my team member and mentor.
We frequently meet with many professionals and leaders. There was a critical meeting with the director of Laurens County half way through the semester. Many points were given on our side and on his side and with one in particular we spoke on the lack of collaboration from the emergency operations manager in Laurens. Each person in the meeting had their time to speak and each fulfilled a leadership role for the areas they were in the meeting to present.
We gathered our entire lab team and everyone talked about their ideas to improve the lab.
We had a company meeting where the CEO has shared his vision with all the employees and motivated on how to reach the targets.
We had a conference meeting with the teachers and the people outside of the website building. I saw that my mentor took initiative and assigned tasks to people who specialize in it.
We had a meeting to discuss fixing up the UPIC page and we all had different ideas on what to do
We had a wonderful group of leaders on my internship. They knew exactly how to talk to us to help us improve.
"We had an overall intern project for streamlined communication to early admitted students and I used my research to allow other interns to brainstorm ideas and the most effective ways to market to early admitted students. This included how to engage them into our social media, how to enhance our website, different platforms of communication, and what kind of content they wanted to see."
We had luncheons that I prepared and shared ideas during
We had monthly ambassador meetings where a group of us within Campus Recreation would meet and share ideas with one another on how we could better the department and what steps needed to be taken to do so.
We had one concept for a video that not everyone was on board to do. I tried to bring in a new perspective to the conversation by talking about the idea logistically. That began a new discussion where people could share their points of view and decide whether or not to go through with the video.
We had several meetings this summer were we able to discuss our visions for this year.
"We had several meetings to discuss what is the next step for the ReadingRecovery website. Everyone shared their ideas on how certain modules or payments should work. In return, everyone listened and expressed concerns if the other person's ideas did not seem complete."
"We had social media meetings every Monday morning at 10 am throughout the semester. In these meetings, we would all express what kinds of content we should create and post throughout the week. I regularly offered to write content and take on responsibility for the group. This allowed me to assume a leadership role in the group."
We had weekly meetings where different team members would present new findings and discussed problems.
"We have a lot of groups come in to use both the video and audio studios, and if they have questions, they will come to the interns. I have helped groups on multiple occasions where the individual students will need help reaching a common goal or completing a task that they had planned. Each student in the group will recognize what they can do to help, whether it's in dealing with equipment or in the production aspect."
"We have a total of ten interns/grad students, plus a large faculty at Baruch everyone has been given the chance to become their own leader. Since all of our projects differ a lot in fields, they are all science related. Therefore we can all relate to each others projects and give feedback to each other, however we were all leaders for our specific fields."
"We have an impact project that every student intern has to participate in to better the team as a whole. I noticed not many people with special needs were attending the game so my boss and I worked on a sensory night so people with sensory needs could attend. This took everyone we had to achieve it, but unfortunately we could not fit it into the schedule this year."
We have had to develop multiple social media contests for Campus Recreation. We all get together and talk about our different ideas for the contests.
We have meetings every week to discuss important things going on in and out of the makerspace. In there our staff gets to have open discussion and share their thoughts with the rest of the interns
We have meetings where we learn new skills together as interns with our mentors. We were doing portraits once and we were going over all the ideas and how to improve each other in certain aspects and it was fun.
"We have monthly department meeting during the intern. In the meeting, the department supervisor first summaries about the accomplishments of the department in the previous month. Then, he encouraged people to comment on the department or other employee one by one, in a very friendly atmosphere. I feel the meeting went out very successfully. The supervisor knows how to encourage people when he is summarizing the accomplishments of the department. After the meeting, he also talk to someone individually, in order to get to know the people more deeply. He also tried to come up with suggestions or plans to help employees to become more successfully."
"We have one employee, [name], who is highly efficient with the Hardinge CNC lathe. None of the other employees are very familiar with the machine. Therefore, as a leadership team, we encouraged [name] to write a training manual for the CNC lathe so that other people would be able to continue its use after he graduates this semester."
"We have team meetings every few weeks in my department. We had to reschedule an event last minute. We all met in the conference room and [name] took charge because she is usually the most organized. She capitalized on everyone's strengths such as her relationship with the Dean, [name]'s ability to schedule and her relationship with the people at the venue, [name]'s relationship with donors and ""people person"" abilities, and the event was rescheduled with an invitation sent out the very next day."
We have to figure out how to do the next step. I will lead the discussion sometimes
"We helped get a political candidate on the ballot for a position. It was a lot of work, and a lot of it was boring. It seemed like it would never end, but I was responsible for reporting our progress back to the candidate and his campaign manager."
we hired student ambassadors to work at the conference and we have a person on our team that will train those students on what they will be doing there
We ran a competition to get more likes to our Facebook page. This was one of our main goals as we wanted our members to be able to reach us through multiple platforms. This contest was something that was important for OLLI as a whole so being in charge of that and seeing how it worked was very interesting and rewarding.
We ran a couple camps for 4H youth around the county and was tasked with not only teaching but inspiring kids to learn more about being proactive members of society through caring for their environment and being aware of the resources they use. Through this process I was able to serve as a role model for the kids and act as a source of knowledge to satisfy all of their curiosities.
We really wanted to change up our social media strategy this semester so we had several meetings about what people wanted from our accounts and the process for requesting things to be put up.
"We went to a local school and were helping explain water issues to the Robotics club. They ultimately needed to design a project that fixed water issues, so it was awesome to facilitate a conversation where they all got to brainstorm ideas."
"We were a team of 3 interns, I led this team. I streamlined the jobs in accordance with the management requirement and channeled the work. I was also involved in talking to the line managers, quality managers, and higher management to keep our work transparent and improved the skill of my co-interns"
We were all self managed projects which required a level of self leadership and responsibility.
We were assigned different project to focus on throughout the semester based on our strength and weaknesses
"We were down an administrative position for most of the semester and there was a new intern that joined the team. I spent most of the first few weeks training her on tasks, answering any questions she had to the best of my ability, and even began certain tasks that I knew were coming up. I also created a task list of when specific things were due to help complete things as efficiently as possible and to remove as much stress as possible."
"We were having a team meeting to discuss how we could improve the culture in our department, and to create a space where everyone could speak freely, I was asked to lead the meeting, rather than my manager. This made it so everyone could share their input freely without feeling like they culd be questioned or recieve backlash."
"We were working on a design for a graphic we were sending out and we got stuck on the way it was looking so I suggested we start throwing out ideas until we found one we liked, which we eventually did."
We worked on a big student profiler project where I was able to edit and organize profiles of students who have received scholarships from Clemson donors. I was able to voice my opinion about how to more efficiently and effectively get such a huge project done.
We would often have different entrepreneurs from the area come to the office. It was interesting to be able to listen to the entrepreneur when they gave advice and sort of walked all of the interns through how they started their own businesses.
"When advising engineering students, many think that engineers cannot study abroad because of the difficult course load. I would listen to their points of view and then together we would look and find programs that fit into their schedule and curriculum and then they would realize and discuss how they actually do have different opportunities to go abroad."
"When all of the new interns were coming in I helped a lot of them get used to the systems that we use in the buildings, and I showed them how to deal with teachers that were having technical issues."
"When asking for feedback on Park-N-Ride, I created multiple surveys (both online and in-person) to distribute regarding people's satisfaction with the program. Also, I would follow-up with them after to get better insight into their thoughts."
"When brainstorming ideas for video content, we often had different ideas. I facilitated conversations about which ideas would work best for us to film at that time."

"When creating an informational brochure, we needed to work with many other people from other partner organizations in order to crate something that would work for everyone. My supervisor created a group of representatives from each of these organizations and put them in contact with me so that we could all work together to make sure that this brochure was accurate when describing other organizations. My supervisor made sure everyone knew our goals and had up to date information."
When creating the Social Justice: LLC I ensured that the program would model current successful programs at peer institutions as well as purpose ensured a positive outcome for students participating.

I was responsible for translating surveys into Spanish in order to better communicate with parents of the hispanic/latino community. Then, I had the responsibility of approaching parents at various school functions and conducting interviews in Spanish."
"When designing the EUREKA! logo, I worked with a team at the Honors College to design the logo. The EUREKA! logo was the common goal, and each staff member had a different point of view on what the logo should look like. I had to take into account the staff as well as alumni to create a design that covered all aspects of the goal."
"when discussing new project ideas for the future, the floor is always open for different ideas to accomplish goals. One of those long goals has been moving the Makerspace to Hendrix to expand"

"When first designing the website for occupancy data, I encouraged discussion about the user interface and functionality of the website by asking questions about the end user and the uses to which collected occupancy data could be put. This helped all interested parties to understand the role that the website might play for others in the organization and ultimately lead to a better design for the website."
"When giving internal feedback to coworkers, it's good to have a second eye on every design because some people catch things that I couldn't catch on my own and vice versa."
"When grading some of the written assignments for the online food course, I made sure to encourage there thoughts while still prompting them to possibly think other ways and explore other ideas."

When I had to train people on protocol
When I have meetings with my mentor we get to share our own ideas and changes that we have of my projects. Our common goal was to improve my projects as best as we could. We shared our opinions and improved our ideas by sharing our own ideas every time we would meet!
When I held the outreach event for the Career Center and Healthy Campus I tried to have student understand the overall goals of both departments and how they connect to what employers want to see in the workforce. Many companies are trying to change their benefit packages to include more aspects of mental and emotional health which is great to share with students and the relevance of our programs to the real world.
"When I helped to lead a tour for the chemical engineering department during the PEER Snapshot/WISE Choice event, I promoted the chemical engineering department to prospective students while also representing PEER/WISE as an inclusive community for the prospective students, many of whom were from underrepresented backgrounds."
"When I presented on a dissection of a product line, most of the presentation was discussion between the audience with each person giving their own point of view."
"When I put on programs at a local school's summer reading camp, I taught a group of third grade students.

When I spoke to other students about my wall designs and how they would work and be put into practice.
"When I was asked if there were any ideas I had for one of the Instagram accounts, I suggested reorganizing their story highlights and adding cover images to each. This was then mentioned to the client who loved the idea and I created what I had in mind. With the help of my supervisor and fellow interns we began the process of doing this for multiple clients and accounts, since it was so well received by the followers of the original account."
"When I was working on the dislinked link health check tool with my fellow two interns, there is one end goal product that we wanted to produce in the end. As I was the older intern who had worked with the team before at the beginning of the semester, the role of directing the interns on where to go in this project fell to me after the senior employees gave us the project requirements. I assisted in giving the three of us a vision of what the design was to look like and what we were working towards. I created work tickets in our work tracking system called Jira and we began to grab those and work on them, and then we could combine code together when we completed tickets and continue to constantly recheck if what we had, was building towards the end goal."
"When I work with the other intern, as he is still learning the ropes to an extent. I let him know that not everything I do is the right way, and that if he finds ways to do things on his own or better ways as a whole to do things to go for it. Of course sharing that info with me is helpful as well because its all a learning experience for both of us."
"When I worked on the homecoming build story about [name], I was told to interview him. I went out and spoke with many different people who had worked wtih him and together with their help, I was able to write a well rounded story."
"When installing parts for a new car, there is a specific 'new model team' that works on the line to install new complex parts before they go into mass production, and when a part needs to be installed on the cube perfectly, my manager would call the new model team from the assembly line to ensure the part was placed properly, and to help troubleshoot potential problems they saw with installation before gaps and flushness were discussed."
"When it came to leadership, I was more behind the scenes observing other leaders in action. Being able to watch the President lead other faculty members and discuss things in higher education."
"When it comes to leadership, I experienced that first hand with my interviewer just to get the intern. In my first round of interviews with the student-athlete department, I felt like it had not gone well because even though I answered their questions, I never had any questions to ask them, which showed how little I actually knew about the program. When I did get the call back about the real internship, I researched the program, practiced what I would say, and had all the questions ready to show my great interest. When I was mentally and physically ready in the interviewer, I felt like the leader, I was in control of the interview to get more information I needed to succeed in this intern."
"When looking at the Watt Center's Instagram account, I noticed some gaps in it. We had not been utilizing the highlights or story features, which I saw as a good way to engage followers. I mentioned this to my mentor and she gave me full responsibility to do whatever I wanted with it. Another intern and I worked to create a ""Frequently Asked Questions"" section for the Instagram highlights. I did research and collaborated with the other intern. I took leadership and created content I thought was helpful and needed."

"When my supervisor splits the different areas of the IAC reports into sections, he selects certain individuals for certain tasks. I often noticed that he assigned new sections to individuals that were more experienced and assigned sections that are more developed (have a template) to individuals that have not been a part of IAC as long. I found this very helpful!"
When our bosses came back from their conference they immediately outlined what they wanted to change and worked with each of strengths to assign tasks to the people best suited for that tasks.
When our deadline was drawing near I had to push everyone to get their part of the job done so the business plan would be whole.
"When our part lab was getting too full and the numbers were slipping, my mentor organized the members from each zone, set and target date and cleared out the lab to help improve our numbers."
"When planning Club Werk It, some problems arose and so I called for an in person meeting with the group fitness instructors and our superiors. I wanted everyone to feel like they were able to voice their opinions and feel that they had a part in this event, so I actively listened and responded to any questions they had."
"When planning our tailgate event, my boss was able to bring in different people from different parts of the company and outside of the company who had different skills to make the event a dynamic and fun event."

"When tasked with producing a video, [mentor] assigned several people separate jobs that were in tune with our technical and creative strengths so that we could produce the video efficiently."
"When the Clemson students were in Haiti for Spring Break, I wrote discussion questions and led reflections every night. Topics for discussion included impressions of Haiti, accomplishments each day, how we as Americans view Haitians from our own cultural perspective, and the difference between agency and advocacy. Everyone was given the chance to contribute their own perspectives. On the last night of discussion, I encouraged everyone to discuss CEDC's role in Haiti and the sustainability of our model. I invited everyone to reflect on what about our role should change moving forward. After much discussion and debate, everyone was able to agree on CEDC's role in the community and how it should change.

"When we decided to reclassify some of our accounts, I became the one to notify others in our department that would be affected by this change and make it easier on them.

I reformatted the RFF form to distribute across our department to make it easier for everyone else to understand and utilize the new accounts. I also assisted in breaking up the classification of prior and current transactions to fit with our new classification."

To fix this issue, another intern and I went to our supervisors and proposed redesigning the board with our campaign posters to create a more visually appealing draw for orientations. They agreed, and gave us feedback on what posters they would like to see, leaving us to decide which ones we would display to the incoming students. Upon completing the board, we received the approval to start bringing it to orientations to represent our department."
"When we were originally given the UPIC Manual assignment, [name] had emailed us the details and gave us the freedom to create it anyway we wanted it as long as we used University approved logos and color palettes.

"While Football has a full time graphic design intern, they also have 7 other part time design interns/volunteers. This wasn't always the case though--they added on 4 more volunteers towards the end of fall 2017. When taking on these four new staff members, I watched my boss sit down and develop a new strategy that eased the new volunteers into the process that we already had set.

Specifically on this trip, they were looking for places to bring the new US Ambassador to Haiti who we found out has a special interest in the eradication of cholera  a disease that ripped through Haiti following the earthquake in 2010. In our village of Cange, there were no cases of cholera following the earthquake which we attribute to a commitment to clean water and sanitation here. The representative from USAID were not familiar with the area and so we had to convey why this was such an important success and why it fits with the Ambassador's vision. While the representative were here, we showed them around all of the projects that the organization has completed and shared facts and figures about each of them. We then sat around and talked about what we thought were some of the biggest issues and successes for the village. All in all, it was a successful meeting and the representative left very impressed that a place like Cange existed in the midst of one of the poorest regions in the country. They said they hoped to bring other important people to visit here and we hope that someday they will."
"While making the ""Exam Week Survival Guide"" video, there were three of us working on it. One being me, another being another intern, and the third being the writing center's intern.

The video ended up turning out so great so the teamwork worked out in the end."

Kinda seemed like a high school situation."
