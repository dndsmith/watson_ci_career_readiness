"When I started up as CPT, a bunch of SPOs were, basically, awful- sleeping in cars, not scanning all buildings, not meeting scan times, going inside, ect. This was at first due to lack of viewable scans (when we were transitioning between systems), but it continued afterwards once the norm of ""slacking"" was established. Changing that was difficult and took many tough conversations and arm-twisting (both for SGTs and LTs to watch for this, as well as with the offending SPOs). With our low numbers now and lack of scan checks with the move and issues for the past month beforehand, there was a danger that this slack-ness would return. I am happy to say it has not, which I think is attributable to a new norm of *quality* to the shifts done, even if we are low on SPOs.",0,1,0
"A large component of my internship involves empowering the girls in the program to love themselves and lead healthy, active lifestyles. At the beginning of each after-school meeting, the girls have a journal prompt that asks them to reflect on the previous lesson we discussed and then allowing them to share their thoughts. I believe this was an incredible way to me to analyze progress and present future topics that needed to be implemented again. From their journal reflections, I felt that I watched the girls grow more confident in themselves. Middle school girls commonly never discuss with friends or family some of the sensitive topics we go over. By sharing their thoughts, they were able to connect with each other and feel united by their feelings.",1,0,0

"Aligning group objectives with global objectives was one of my primary roles in my internship. I was working with teams who are working on a variety of projects to address needs in Haiti.

There was a constant need for relating small goals to global issues, particularly the global water crisis.",1,0,0

"As a director, I am forced to take the lead on all projects and do things that other may not want to do.

"Being in charge of the graphics team, there were many instances where I was able to direct and lead members to achieve a vision I had if the task was delegated to them.

"I had a problem mid-way through the semester with my higher ups not being responsible and allowing the lower ranking workers to get away with things that should not have been allowed. I had to call a meeting with everyone who was in that position to completely go over everything that they were supposed to have already been doing, and then added new steps to increase accountability in that position. I had to spend a lot of time checking back over their work to make sure that everything was on track, but so far the work has been exceptional!",0,1,0
