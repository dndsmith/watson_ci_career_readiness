1,1_0,"""When I started up as CPT"
1,1_1, a bunch of SPOs were

1,1_3, awful- sleeping in cars
1,1_4, not scanning all buildings
1,1_5, not meeting scan times
1,1_6, going inside
1,1_7, ect
1,1_8, This was at first due to lack of viewable scans (when we were transitioning between systems)
1,1_9," but it continued afterwards once the norm of """"slacking"""" was established"
1,1_10, Changing that was difficult and took many tough conversations and arm-twisting (both for SGTs and LTs to watch for this
1,1_11, as well as with the offending SPOs)
1,1_12, With our low numbers now and lack of scan checks with the move and issues for the past month beforehand
1,1_13, there was a danger that this slack-ness would return
1,1_14, I am happy to say it has not
1,1_15, which I think is attributable to a new norm of *quality* to the shifts done
