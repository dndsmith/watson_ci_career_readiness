# IBM Watson CI Career Readiness Project
The career readiness project seeks to help the Career Center quantiatively evaluate the career readiness of students by applying machine learning techniques to open-ended survey responses from former UPIC interns and their mentors.

This branch is for experimentation purposes and is for saving results of code experiments.
